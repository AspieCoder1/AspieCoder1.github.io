#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am an MPhil Advanced Computer Science student at the University of Cambridge, Department of Computer Science and Technology as a member of [Peterhouse](https://www.pet.cam.ac.uk).
My research focused on exploring sheaf-based graph neural networks for processing heterogeneous graph data and is supervised by [Professor Pietro LiÃ²](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/).

Before this I completed my undergrad in computer science at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) where I graduated with first-class honours.
My dissertation was supervised by [Professor Gavin Brown](https://profgavinbrown.github.io/) and explored how the bias-variance tradeoff can be used to describe the performance on machine learning models.
