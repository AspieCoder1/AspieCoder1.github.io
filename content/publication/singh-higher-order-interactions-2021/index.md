abstract: Higher order interactions (HOIs) have been suggested to stabilize diverse
  ecological communities. However, their role in maintaining species coexistence from
  the perspective of modern coexistence theory is not known. Here, using generalized
  Lotka-Volterra model, we derive a general rule for species coexistence modulated
  by HOIs. We show that where pairwise species interactions fail to promote species
  coexistence in regions of extreme fitness differences, negative HOIs that intensify
  pairwise competition, however, can promote coexistence provided that HOIs strengthen
  intraspecific competition more than interspecific competition. In contrast, positive
  HOIs that alleviate pairwise competition can stabilize coexistence across a wide
  range of fitness differences, irrespective of differences in strength of inter-
  and intraspecific competition. In addition, we extend our three-species analytical
  result to multispecies communities and show, using simulations, that multispecies
  coexistence is possible provided that strength of negative intraspecific HOIs is
  higher than interspecific HOIs. Our work sheds light on the underlying mechanisms
  through which HOIs can maintain species diversity.
