abstract: Learning from structured data is a core machine learning task. Commonly,
  such data is represented as graphs, which normally only consider (typed) binary
  relationships between pairs of nodes. This is a substantial limitation for many
  domains with highly-structured data. One important such domain is source code, where
  hypergraph-based representations can better capture the semantically rich and structured
  nature of code. In this work, we present HEAT, a neural model capable of representing
  typed and qualified hypergraphs, where each hyperedge explicitly qualifies how participating
  nodes contribute. It can be viewed as a generalization of both message passing neural
  networks and Transformers. We evaluate HEAT on knowledge base completion and on
  bug detection and repair using a novel hypergraph representation of programs. In
  both settings, it outperforms strong baselines, indicating its power and generality.
