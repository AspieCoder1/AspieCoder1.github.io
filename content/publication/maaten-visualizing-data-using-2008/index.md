abstract: We present a new technique called \"t-SNE\" that visualizes high-dimensional
  data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The
  technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002)
  that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations
  by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE
  is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure
  at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data
  that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images
  ofobjects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the
  structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood
  graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in
  which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE
  on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization
  techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The
  visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by
  the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.
