abstract: We investigate Relational Graph Attention Networks, a class of models that
  extends non-relational graph attention mechanisms to incorporate relational information,
  opening up these methods to a wider variety of problems. A thorough evaluation of
  these models is performed, and comparisons are made against established benchmarks.
  To provide a meaningful comparison, we retrain Relational Graph Convolutional Networks,
  the spectral counterpart of Relational Graph Attention Networks, and evaluate them
  under the same conditions. We find that Relational Graph Attention Networks perform
  worse than anticipated, although some configurations are marginally beneficial for
  modelling molecular properties. We provide insights as to why this may be, and suggest
  both modifications to evaluation strategies, as well as directions to investigate
  for future work.
