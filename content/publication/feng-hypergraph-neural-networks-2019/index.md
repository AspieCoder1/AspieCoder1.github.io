abstract: In this paper, we present a hypergraph neural networks (HGNN) framework
  for data representation learning, which can encode high-order data correlation in
  a hypergraph structure. Confronting the challenges of learning representation for
  complex data in real practice, we propose to incorporate such data structure in
  a hypergraph, which is more flexible on data modeling, especially when dealing with
  complex data. In this method, a hyperedge convolution operation is designed to handle
  the data correlation during representation learning. In this way, traditional hypergraph
  learning procedure can be conducted using hyperedge convolution operations efficiently.
  HGNN is able to learn the hidden layer representation considering the high-order
  data structure, which is a general framework considering the complex data correlations.
  We have conducted experiments on citation network classification and visual object
  recognition tasks and compared HGNN with graph convolutional networks and other
  traditional methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HGNN method
  outperforms recent state-of-theart methods. We can also reveal from the results
  that the proposed HGNN is superior when dealing with multi-modal data compared with
  existing methods.
