abstract: This paper rigorously establishes that standard multilayer feedforward networks
  with as few as one hidden layer using arbitrary squashing functions are capable
  of approximating any Borel measurable function from one finite dimensional space
  to another to any desired degree of accuracy, provided sufficiently many hidden
  units are available. In this sense, multilayer feedforward networks are a class
  of universal approximators.
