abstract: We introduce the variational graph auto-encoder (VGAE), a framework for
  unsupervised learning on graph-structured data based on the variational auto-encoder
  (VAE). This model makes use of latent variables and is capable of learning interpretable
  latent representations for undirected graphs. We demonstrate this model using a
  graph convolutional network (GCN) encoder and a simple inner product decoder. Our
  model achieves competitive results on a link prediction task in citation networks.
  In contrast to most existing models for unsupervised learning on graph-structured
  data and link prediction, our model can naturally incorporate node features, which
  significantly improves predictive performance on a number of benchmark datasets.
