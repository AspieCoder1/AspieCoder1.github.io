abstract: Human social interactions in local settings can be experimentally detected
  by recording the physical proximity and orientation of people. Such interactions,
  approximating face-to-face communications, can be effectively represented as time
  varying social networks with links being unceasingly created and destroyed over
  time. Traditional analyses of temporal networks have addressed mostly pairwise interactions,
  where links describe dyadic connections among individuals. However, many network
  dynamics are hardly ascribable to pairwise settings but often comprise larger groups,
  which are better described by higher-order interactions. Here we investigate the
  higher-order organizations of temporal social networks by analyzing five publicly
  available datasets collected in different social settings. We find that higher-order
  interactions are ubiquitous and, similarly to their pairwise counterparts, characterized
  by heterogeneous dynamics, with bursty trains of rapidly recurring higher-order
  events separated by long periods of inactivity. We investigate the evolution and
  formation of groups by looking at the transition rates between different higher-order
  structures. We find that in more spontaneous social settings, group are characterized
  by slower formation and disaggregation, while in work settings these phenomena are
  more abrupt, possibly reflecting pre-organized social dynamics. Finally, we observe
  temporal reinforcement suggesting that the longer a group stays together the higher
  the probability that the same interaction pattern persist in the future. Our findings
  suggest the importance of considering the higher-order structure of social interactions
  when investigating human temporal dynamics.
