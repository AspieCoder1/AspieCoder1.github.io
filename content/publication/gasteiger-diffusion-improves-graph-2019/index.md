abstract: 'Graph convolution is the core of most Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and
  usually approximated by message passing between direct (one-hop) neighbors. In this
  work, we remove the restriction of using only the direct neighbors by introducing
  a powerful, yet spatially localized graph convolution: Graph diffusion convolution
  (GDC). GDC leverages generalized graph diffusion, examples of which are the heat
  kernel and personalized PageRank. It alleviates the problem of noisy and often arbitrarily
  defined edges in real graphs. We show that GDC is closely related to spectral-based
  models and thus combines the strengths of both spatial (message passing) and spectral
  methods. We demonstrate that replacing message passing with graph diffusion convolution
  consistently leads to significant performance improvements across a wide range of
  models on both supervised and unsupervised tasks and a variety of datasets. Furthermore,
  GDC is not limited to GNNs but can trivially be combined with any graph-based model
  or algorithm (e.g. spectral clustering) without requiring any changes to the latter
  or affecting its computational complexity. Our implementation is available online.'
