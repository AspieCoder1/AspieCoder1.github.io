abstract: Proving mathematical theorems at the olympiad level represents a notable
  milestone in human-level automated reasoning1–4, owing to their reputed difficulty
  among the world’s best talents in pre-university mathematics. Current machine-learning
  approaches, however, are not applicable to most mathematical domains owing to the
  high cost of translating human proofs into machine-verifiable format. The problem
  is even worse for geometry because of its unique translation challenges1,5, resulting
  in severe scarcity of training data. We propose AlphaGeometry, a theorem prover
  for Euclidean plane geometry that sidesteps the need for human demonstrations by
  synthesizing millions of theorems and proofs across different levels of complexity.
  AlphaGeometry is a neuro-symbolic system that uses a neural language model, trained
  from scratch on our large-scale synthetic data, to guide a symbolic deduction engine
  through infinite branching points in challenging problems. On a test set of 30 latest
  olympiad-level problems, AlphaGeometry solves 25, outperforming the previous best
  method that only solves ten problems and approaching the performance of an average
  International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) gold medallist. Notably, AlphaGeometry
  produces human-readable proofs, solves all geometry problems in the IMO 2000 and
  2015 under human expert evaluation and discovers a generalized version of a~translated
  IMO theorem in 2004.
