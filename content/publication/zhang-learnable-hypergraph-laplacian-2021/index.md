abstract: HyperGraph Convolutional Neural Networks (HGCNNs) have demonstrated their
  potential in modeling high-order relations preserved in graph structured data. However,
  most existing convolution filters are localized and determined by the pre-defined
  initial hypergraph topology, neglecting to explore implicit and long-ange relations
  in real-world data. In this paper, we propose the first learning-based method tailored
  for constructing adaptive hypergraph structure, termed HypERgrAph Laplacian aDaptor
  (HERALD), which serves as a generic plug-in-play module for improving the representational
  power of HGCNNs. Specifically, HERALD adaptively optimizes the adjacency relationship
  between hypernodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end manner and thus the task-aware
  hypergraph is learned. Furthermore, HERALD employs the self-attention mechanism
  to capture the non-local paired-nodes relation. Extensive experiments on various
  popular hypergraph datasets for node classification and graph classification tasks
  demonstrate that our approach obtains consistent and considerable performance enhancement,
  proving its effectiveness and generalization ability.
