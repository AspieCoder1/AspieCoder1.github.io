abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to be effective models for
  different predictive tasks on graph-structured data. Recent work on their expressive
  power has focused on isomorphism tasks and countable feature spaces. We extend this
  theoretical framework to include continuous features---which occur regularly in
  real-world input domains and within the hidden layers of GNNs---and we demonstrate
  the requirement for multiple aggregation functions in this context. Accordingly,
  we propose Principal Neighbourhood Aggregation (PNA), a novel architecture combining
  multiple aggregators with degree-scalers (which generalize the sum aggregator).
  Finally, we compare the capacity of different models to capture and exploit the
  graph structure via a novel benchmark containing multiple tasks taken from classical
  graph theory, alongside existing benchmarks from real-world domains, all of which
  demonstrate the strength of our model. With this work we hope to steer some of the
  GNN research towards new aggregation methods which we believe are essential in the
  search for powerful and robust models.
