abstract: 'Self-supervised heterogeneous graph learning has achieved promising results
  in various real applications, but it still suffers from the following issues: (i)
  meta-paths are employed to capture the homogeneity in the heterogeneous graph, but
  meta-paths are human-defined, requiring substantial expert knowledge and computational
  costs; and (ii) the heterogeneity in the heterogeneous graph is generally underutilized,
  leading to the loss of task-related information. To solve these issues, this paper
  proposes to capture both homogeneity and heterogeneity in the heterogeneous graph
  without pre-defined meta-paths. Specifically, we propose to learn a self-expressive
  matrix to capture the homogeneity from the subspace and nearby neighbors. Meanwhile,
  we propose to capture the heterogeneity by aggregating the information of nodes
  from different types. We further design a consistency loss and a specificity loss,
  respectively, to extract the consistent information between homogeneity and heterogeneity
  and to preserve their specific task-related information. We theoretically analyze
  that the learned homogeneous representations exhibit the grouping effect to capture
  the homogeneity, and considering both homogeneity and heterogeneity introduces more
  task-related information. Extensive experimental results verify the superiority
  of the proposed method on different downstream tasks.'
