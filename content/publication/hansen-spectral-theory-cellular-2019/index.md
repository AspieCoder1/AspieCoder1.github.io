abstract: This paper outlines a program in what one might call spectral sheaf theoryâ€”an
  extension of spectral graph theory to cellular sheaves. By lifting the combinatorial
  graph Laplacian to the Hodge Laplacian on a cellular sheaf of vector spaces over
  a regular cell complex, one can relate spectral data to the sheaf cohomology and
  cell structure in a manner reminiscent of spectral graph theory. This work gives
  an exploratory introduction, and includes discussion of eigenvalue interlacing,
  sparsification, effective resistance, synchronization, and sheaf approximation.
  These results and subsequent applications are prefaced by an introduction to cellular
  sheaves and Laplacians.
