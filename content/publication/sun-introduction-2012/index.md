abstract: We are living in an interconnected world. Most of data or informational
  objects, individual agents, groups, or components are interconnected or interact
  with each other, forming numerous, large, interconnected, and sophisticated networks.
  Without loss of generality, such interconnected networks are called information
  networks in this book. Examples of information networks include social networks,
  the World Wide Web, research publication networks [22], biological networks [55],
  highway networks [32], public health systems, electrical power grids, and so on.
  Clearly, information networks are ubiquitous and form a critical component of modern
  information infrastructure. The analysis of information networks, or their special
  kinds, such as social networks and the Web, has gained extremely wide attentions
  nowadays from researchers in computer science, social science, physics, economics,
  biology, and so on, with exciting discoveries and successful applications across
  all the disciplines.
