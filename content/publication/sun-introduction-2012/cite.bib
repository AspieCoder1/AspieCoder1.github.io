 abstract = {We are living in an interconnected world. Most of data or informational objects, individual agents, groups, or components are interconnected or interact with each other, forming numerous, large, interconnected, and sophisticated networks. Without loss of generality, such interconnected networks are called information networks in this book. Examples of information networks include social networks, the World Wide Web, research publication networks [22], biological networks [55], highway networks [32], public health systems, electrical power grids, and so on. Clearly, information networks are ubiquitous and form a critical component of modern information infrastructure. The analysis of information networks, or their special kinds, such as social networks and the Web, has gained extremely wide attentions nowadays from researchers in computer science, social science, physics, economics, biology, and so on, with exciting discoveries and successful applications across all the disciplines.},
