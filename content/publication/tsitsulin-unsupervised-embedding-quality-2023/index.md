abstract: 'Unsupervised learning has recently significantly gained in popularity,
  especially with deep learning-based approaches. Despite numerous successes and approaching
  supervised-level performance on a variety of academic benchmarks, it is still hard
  to train and evaluate SSL models in practice due to the unsupervised nature of the
  problem. Even with networks trained in a supervised fashion, it is often unclear
  whether they will perform well when transferred to another domain. Past works are
  generally limited to assessing the amount of information contained in embeddings,
  which is most relevant for self-supervised learning of deep neural networks. This
  works chooses to follow a different approach: can we quantify how easy it is to
  linearly separate the data in a stable way? We survey the literature and uncover
  three methods that could be potentially used for evaluating quality of representations.
  We also introduce one novel method based on recent advances in understanding the
  high-dimensional geometric structure of self-supervised learning. We conduct extensive
  experiments and study the properties of these metrics and ones introduced in the
  previous work. Our results suggest that while there is no free lunch, there are
  metrics that can robustly estimate embedding quality in an unsupervised way.'
