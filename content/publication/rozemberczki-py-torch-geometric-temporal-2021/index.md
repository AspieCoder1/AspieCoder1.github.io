abstract: We present PyTorch Geometric Temporal a deep learning framework combining
  state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for neural spatiotemporal signal processing.
  The main goal of the library is to make temporal geometric deep learning available
  for researchers and machine learning practitioners in a unified easy-to-use framework.
  PyTorch Geometric Temporal was created with foundations on existing libraries in
  the PyTorch eco-system, streamlined neural network layer definitions, temporal snapshot
  generators for batching, and integrated benchmark datasets. These features are illustrated
  with a tutorial-like case study. Experiments demonstrate the predictive performance
  of the models implemented in the library on real world problems such as epidemiological
  forecasting, ridehail demand prediction and web-traffic management. Our sensitivity
  analysis of runtime shows that the framework can potentially operate on web-scale
  datasets with rich temporal features and spatial structure.
