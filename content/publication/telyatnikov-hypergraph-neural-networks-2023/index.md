abstract: 'Most of the current hypergraph learning methodologies and benchmarking
  datasets in the hypergraph realm are obtained by lifting procedures from their graph
  analogs, simultaneously leading to overshadowing hypergraph network foundations.
  This paper attempts to confront some pending questions in that regard: Can the concept
  of homophily play a crucial role in Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs), similar
  to its significance in graph-based research? Is there room for improving current
  hypergraph architectures and methodologies? (e.g. by carefully addressing the specific
  characteristics of higher-order networks) Do existing datasets provide a meaningful
  benchmark for HGNNs? Diving into the details, this paper proposes a novel conceptualization
  of homophily in higher-order networks based on a message passing scheme; this approach
  harmonizes the analytical frameworks of datasets and architectures, offering a unified
  perspective for exploring and interpreting complex, higher-order network structures
  and dynamics. Further, we propose MultiSet, a novel message passing framework that
  redefines HGNNs by allowing hyperedge-dependent node representations, as well as
  introduce a novel architecture MultiSetMixer that leverages a new hyperedge sampling
  strategy. Finally, we provide an extensive set of experiments that contextualize
  our proposals and lead to valuable insights in hypergraph representation learning.'
