 abstract = {Most of the current hypergraph learning methodologies and benchmarking datasets in the hypergraph realm are obtained by lifting procedures from their graph analogs, simultaneously leading to overshadowing hypergraph network foundations. This paper attempts to confront some pending questions in that regard: Can the concept of homophily play a crucial role in Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs), similar to its significance in graph-based research? Is there room for improving current hypergraph architectures and methodologies? (e.g. by carefully addressing the specific characteristics of higher-order networks) Do existing datasets provide a meaningful benchmark for HGNNs? Diving into the details, this paper proposes a novel conceptualization of homophily in higher-order networks based on a message passing scheme; this approach harmonizes the analytical frameworks of datasets and architectures, offering a unified perspective for exploring and interpreting complex, higher-order network structures and dynamics. Further, we propose MultiSet, a novel message passing framework that redefines HGNNs by allowing hyperedge-dependent node representations, as well as introduce a novel architecture MultiSetMixer that leverages a new hyperedge sampling strategy. Finally, we provide an extensive set of experiments that contextualize our proposals and lead to valuable insights in hypergraph representation learning.},
