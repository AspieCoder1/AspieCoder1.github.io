abstract: Graph neural network, as a powerful graph representation technique based
  on deep learning, has shown superior performance and attracted considerable research
  interest. However, it has not been fully considered in graph neural network for
  heterogeneous graph which contains different types of nodes and links. The heterogeneity
  and rich semantic information bring great challenges for designing a graph neural
  network for heterogeneous graph. Recently, one of the most exciting advancements
  in deep learning is the attention mechanism, whose great potential has been well
  demonstrated in various areas. In this paper, we first propose a novel heterogeneous
  graph neural network based on the hierarchical attention, including node-level and
  semantic-level attentions. Specifically, the node-level attention aims to learn
  the importance between a node and its metapath based neighbors, while the semantic-level
  attention is able to learn the importance of different meta-paths. With the learned
  importance from both node-level and semantic-level attention, the importance of
  node and meta-path can be fully considered. Then the proposed model can generate
  node embedding by aggregating features from meta-path based neighbors in a hierarchical
  manner. Extensive experimental results on three real-world heterogeneous graphs
  not only show the superior performance of our proposed model over the state-of-the-arts,
  but also demonstrate its potentially good interpretability for graph analysis.
