abstract: A large number of real-world graphs or networks are inherently heterogeneous,
  involving a diversity of node types and relation types. Heterogeneous graph embedding
  is to embed rich structural and semantic information of a heterogeneous graph into
  low-dimensional node representations. Existing models usually define multiple metapaths
  in a heterogeneous graph to capture the composite relations and guide neighbor selection.
  However, these models either omit node content features, discard intermediate nodes
  along the metapath, or only consider one metapath. To address these three limitations,
  we propose a new model named Metapath Aggregated Graph Neural Network (MAGNN) to
  boost the final performance. Specifically, MAGNN employs three major components,
  i.e., the node content transformation to encapsulate input node attributes, the
  intra-metapath aggregation to incorporate intermediate semantic nodes, and the inter-metapath
  aggregation to combine messages from multiple metapaths. Extensive experiments on
  three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets for node classification, node clustering,
  and link prediction show that MAGNN achieves more accurate prediction results than
  state-of-the-art baselines.
