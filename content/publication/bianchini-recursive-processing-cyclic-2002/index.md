abstract: Recursive neural networks are a powerful tool for processing structured
  data. According to the recursive learning paradigm, the information to be processed
  consists of directed positional acyclic graphs (DPAGs). In fact, recursive networks
  are fed following the partial order defined by the links of the graph. Unfortunately,
  the hypothesis of processing DPAGs is sometimes too restrictive, being the nature
  of some real-world problems intrinsically disordered and cyclic. In the paper, a
  methodology is proposed which allows us to map any cyclic directed graph into a
  \"recursive-equivalent\" tree. Therefore, the computational power of recursive networks
  is definitely established, also clarifying the underlying limitations of the model.
