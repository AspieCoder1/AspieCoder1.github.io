 abstract = {We introduce  ε\ varepsilon  -approximate versions of the notion of a Euclidean vector bundle for  ε≥0\ varepsilon \ geq 0 , which recover the classical notion of a Euclidean vector bundle when  ε=0\ varepsilon = 0 . In particular, we study Čech cochains with coefficients in the orthogonal group that satisfy an approximate cocycle condition. We show that  ε\ varepsilon  -approximate vector bundles can be used to represent classical vector bundles when  ε$>$0\ varepsilon$>$ 0  is sufficiently small. We also introduce distances between approximate vector bundles and use them to prove that sufficiently similar approximate vector bundles represent the same classical vector bundle. This gives a way of specifying vector bundles over finite simplicial complexes using a finite amount of data and also allows for some tolerance to noise when working with vector bundles in an applied setting. As an example, we prove a reconstruction theorem for vector bundles from finite samples. We give algorithms for the effective computation of low-dimensional characteristic classes of vector bundles directly from discrete and approximate representations and illustrate the usage of these algorithms with computational examples.},
