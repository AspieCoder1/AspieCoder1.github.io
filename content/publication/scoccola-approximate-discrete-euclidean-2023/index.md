abstract: We introduce  ε varepsilon  -approximate versions of the notion of a Euclidean
  vector bundle for  ε≥0 varepsilon  geq 0 , which recover the classical notion of
  a Euclidean vector bundle when  ε=0 varepsilon = 0 . In particular, we study Čech
  cochains with coefficients in the orthogonal group that satisfy an approximate cocycle
  condition. We show that  ε varepsilon  -approximate vector bundles can be used to
  represent classical vector bundles when  ε$>$0 varepsilon$>$ 0  is sufficiently
  small. We also introduce distances between approximate vector bundles and use them
  to prove that sufficiently similar approximate vector bundles represent the same
  classical vector bundle. This gives a way of specifying vector bundles over finite
  simplicial complexes using a finite amount of data and also allows for some tolerance
  to noise when working with vector bundles in an applied setting. As an example,
  we prove a reconstruction theorem for vector bundles from finite samples. We give
  algorithms for the effective computation of low-dimensional characteristic classes
  of vector bundles directly from discrete and approximate representations and illustrate
  the usage of these algorithms with computational examples.
