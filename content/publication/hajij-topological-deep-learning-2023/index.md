abstract: Topological deep learning is a rapidly growing field that pertains to the
  development of deep learning models for data supported on topological domains such
  as simplicial complexes, cell complexes, and hypergraphs, which generalize many
  domains encountered in scientific computations. In this paper, we present a unifying
  deep learning framework built upon a richer data structure that includes widely
  adopted topological domains. Specifically, we first introduce combinatorial complexes,
  a novel type of topological domain. Combinatorial complexes can be seen as generalizations
  of graphs that maintain certain desirable properties. Similar to hypergraphs, combinatorial
  complexes impose no constraints on the set of relations. In addition, combinatorial
  complexes permit the construction of hierarchical higher-order relations, analogous
  to those found in simplicial and cell complexes. Thus, combinatorial complexes generalize
  and combine useful traits of both hypergraphs and cell complexes, which have emerged
  as two promising abstractions that facilitate the generalization of graph neural
  networks to topological spaces. Second, building upon combinatorial complexes and
  their rich combinatorial and algebraic structure, we develop a general class of
  message-passing combinatorial complex neural networks (CCNNs), focusing primarily
  on attention-based CCNNs. We characterize permutation and orientation equivariances
  of CCNNs, and discuss pooling and unpooling operations within CCNNs in detail. Third,
  we evaluate the performance of CCNNs on tasks related to mesh shape analysis and
  graph learning. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNNs have competitive performance
  as compared to state-of-the-art deep learning models specifically tailored to the
  same tasks. Our findings demonstrate the advantages of incorporating higher-order
  relations into deep learning models in different applications.
