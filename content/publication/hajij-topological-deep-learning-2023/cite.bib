 abstract = {Topological deep learning is a rapidly growing field that pertains to the development of deep learning models for data supported on topological domains such as simplicial complexes, cell complexes, and hypergraphs, which generalize many domains encountered in scientific computations. In this paper, we present a unifying deep learning framework built upon a richer data structure that includes widely adopted topological domains. Specifically, we first introduce combinatorial complexes, a novel type of topological domain. Combinatorial complexes can be seen as generalizations of graphs that maintain certain desirable properties. Similar to hypergraphs, combinatorial complexes impose no constraints on the set of relations. In addition, combinatorial complexes permit the construction of hierarchical higher-order relations, analogous to those found in simplicial and cell complexes. Thus, combinatorial complexes generalize and combine useful traits of both hypergraphs and cell complexes, which have emerged as two promising abstractions that facilitate the generalization of graph neural networks to topological spaces. Second, building upon combinatorial complexes and their rich combinatorial and algebraic structure, we develop a general class of message-passing combinatorial complex neural networks (CCNNs), focusing primarily on attention-based CCNNs. We characterize permutation and orientation equivariances of CCNNs, and discuss pooling and unpooling operations within CCNNs in detail. Third, we evaluate the performance of CCNNs on tasks related to mesh shape analysis and graph learning. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNNs have competitive performance as compared to state-of-the-art deep learning models specifically tailored to the same tasks. Our findings demonstrate the advantages of incorporating higher-order relations into deep learning models in different applications.},
