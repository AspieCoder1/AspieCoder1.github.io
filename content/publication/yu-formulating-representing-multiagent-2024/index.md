abstract: Graph-learning methods, especially graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown
  remarkable effectiveness in handling non-Euclidean data and have achieved great
  success in various scenarios. Existing GNNs are primarily based on message-passing
  schemes, that is, aggregating information from neighboring nodes. However, the diversity
  and complexity of complex systems from real-world circumstances are not sufficiently
  taken into account. In these cases, the individual should be treated as an agent,
  with the ability to perceive their surroundings and interact with other individuals,
  rather than just be viewed as nodes in existing graph approaches. Additionally,
  the pairwise interactions used in existing methods also lack the expressiveness
  for the higher-order complex relations among multiple agents, thus limiting the
  performance in various tasks. In this work, we propose a Multiagent Hypergraph Force-learning
  method dubbed MHGForce. First, we formalize the multiagent system (MAS) and illustrate
  its connection to graph learning. Then, we propose a generalized multiagent hypergraph-learning
  framework. In this framework, we integrate message-passing and force-based interactions
  to devise a pluggable method. The method empowers graph approaches to excel in downstream
  tasks while effectively maintaining structural information in the representations.
  Experimental results on the Cora, Citeseer, Cora-CA, Zoo, and NTU2012 datasets in
  node classification demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our proposed
  method. We also discuss the characteristics of the MHGForce and explore its role
  through parametric analysis and visualization. Finally, we give a discussion, conclude
  our work, and propose future directions.
