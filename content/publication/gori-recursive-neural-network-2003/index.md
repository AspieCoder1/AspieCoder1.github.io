abstract: The recursive paradigm extends the neural network processing and learning
  algorithms to deal with structured inputs. In particular, recursive neural network
  (RNN) models have been proposed to process information coded as directed positional
  acyclic graphs (DPAGs) whose maximum node outdegree is known a priori. Unfortunately,
  the hypothesis of processing DPAGs having a given maximum node outdegree is sometimes
  too restrictive, being the nature of some real-world problems intrinsically disordered.
  In many applications the node outdegrees can vary considerably among the nodes in
  the graph, it may be unnatural to define a position for each child of a given node,
  and it may be necessary to prune some edges to reduce the number of the network
  parameters, which is proportional to the maximum node outdegree. In this paper,
  we proposed a new recursive neural network model which allows us to process directed
  acyclic graphs (DAGs) with labeled edges, relaxing the positional constraint and
  the correlated maximum outdegree limit. The effectiveness of the new scheme is experimentally
  tested on an image classification task. The results show that the new RNN model
  outperforms the standard RNN architecture, also allowing us to use a smaller number
  of free parameters.
