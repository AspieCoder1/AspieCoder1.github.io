abstract: Identifying the political perspective shaping the way news events are discussed
  in the media is an important and challenging task. In this paper, we highlight the
  importance of contextualizing social information, capturing how this information
  is disseminated in social networks. We use Graph Convolutional Networks, a recently
  proposed neural architecture for representing relational information, to capture
  the documents' social context. We show that social information can be used effectively
  as a source of distant supervision, and when direct supervision is available, even
  little social information can significantly improve performance.
