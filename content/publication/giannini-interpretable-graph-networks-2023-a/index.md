abstract: "The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) recently empowered researchers
  to investigate hard mathematical problems which eluded traditional approaches for
  decades. Yet, the use of AI in Universal Algebra (UA)---one of the fields laying
  the foundations of modern mathematics---is still completely unexplored. This work
  proposes the first use of AI to investigate UA's conjectures with an equivalent
  equational and topological characterization. While topological representations would
  enable the analysis of such properties using graph neural networks, the limited
  transparency and brittle explainability of these models hinder their straightforward
  use to empirically validate existing conjectures or to formulate new ones. To bridge
  these gaps, we propose a general algorithm generating AI-ready datasets based on
  UA's conjectures, and introduce a novel neural layer to build fully interpretable
  graph networks. The results of our experiments demonstrate that interpretable graph
  networks: (i) enhance interpretability without sacrificing task accuracy, (ii) strongly
  generalize when predicting universal algebra's properties, (iii) generate simple
  explanations that empirically validate existing conjectures, and (iv) identify subgraphs
  suggesting the formulation of novel conjectures."
