abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a powerful architecture for tackling graph
  learning tasks, yet have been shown to be oblivious to eminent substructures such
  as cycles. We present TOGL, a novel layer that incorporates global topological information
  of a graph using persistent homology. TOGL can be easily integrated into any type
  of GNN and is strictly more expressive (in terms the Weisfeiler--Lehman graph isomorphism
  test) than message-passing GNNs. Augmenting GNNs with TOGL leads to improved predictive
  performance for graph and node classification tasks, both on synthetic data sets,
  which can be classified by humans using their topology but not by ordinary GNNs,
  and on real-world data.
