abstract: Advancing research in the emerging field of deep graph learning requires
  new tools to support tensor computation over graphs. In this paper, we present the
  design principles and implementation of Deep Graph Library (DGL). DGL distills the
  computational patterns of GNNs into a few generalized sparse tensor operations suitable
  for extensive parallelization. By advocating graph as the central programming abstraction,
  DGL can perform optimizations transparently. By cautiously adopting a framework-neutral
  design, DGL allows users to easily port and leverage the existing components across
  multiple deep learning frameworks. Our evaluation shows that DGL significantly outperforms
  other popular GNN-oriented frameworks in both speed and memory consumption over
  a variety of benchmarks and has little overhead for small scale workloads.
