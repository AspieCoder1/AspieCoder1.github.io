abstract: Most objects and data in the real world are of multiple types, interconnected,
  forming complex, heterogeneous but often semi-structured information networks. However,
  most network science researchers are focused on homogeneous networks, without distinguishing
  different types of objects and links in the networks. We view interconnected, multityped
  data, including the typical relational database data, as heterogeneous information
  networks, study how to leverage the rich semantic meaning of structural types of
  objects and links in the networks, and develop a structural analysis approach on
  mining semi-structured, multi-typed heterogeneous information networks. In this
  article, we summarize a set of methodologies that can effectively and efficiently
  mine useful knowledge from such information networks, and point out some promising
  research directions.
