abstract: Interpretability has become an important topic of research as more machine
  learning (ML) models are deployed and widely used to make important decisions.      Most
  of the current explanation methods provide explanations through feature importance
  scores, which identify features that are important for each individual input. However,
  how to systematically summarize and interpret such per sample feature importance
  scores itself is challenging. In this work, we propose principles and desiderata
  for  emphoÌ§ncept based explanation, which goes beyond per-sample features to identify
  higher level human-understandable concepts that apply across the entire dataset.
  We develop a new algorithm, ACE, to automatically extract visual concepts. Our systematic
  experiments demonstrate that  alg discovers concepts that are human-meaningful,
  coherent and important for the neural network's predictions.
