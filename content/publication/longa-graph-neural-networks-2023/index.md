abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the leading paradigm for learning
  on (static) graph-structured data. However, many real-world systems are dynamic
  in nature, since the graph and node/edge attributes change over time. In recent
  years, GNN-based models for temporal graphs have emerged as a promising area of
  research to extend the capabilities of GNNs. In this work, we provide the first
  comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art of temporal GNN, introducing
  a rigorous formalization of learning settings and tasks and a novel taxonomy categorizing
  existing approaches in terms of how the temporal aspect is represented and processed.
  We conclude the survey with a discussion of the most relevant open challenges for
  the field, from both research and application perspectives.
