abstract: Abstract             First released in 2006, DrugBank (https://go.drugbank.com)
  has grown to become the ‘gold standard’ knowledge resource for drug, drug–target
  and related pharmaceutical information. DrugBank is widely used across many diverse
  biomedical research and clinical applications, and averages more than 30 million
  views/year. Since its last update in 2018, we have been actively enhancing the quantity
  and quality of the drug data in this knowledgebase. In this latest release (DrugBank
  6.0), the number of FDA approved drugs has grown from 2646 to 4563 (a 72% increase),
  the number of investigational drugs has grown from 3394 to 6231 (a 38% increase),
  the number of drug–drug interactions increased from 365 984 to 1 413 413 (a 300%
  increase), and the number of drug–food interactions expanded from 1195 to 2475 (a
  200% increase). In addition to this notable expansion in database size, we have
  added thousands of new, colorful, richly annotated pathways depicting drug mechanisms
  and drug metabolism. Likewise, existing datasets have been significantly improved
  and expanded, by adding more information on drug indications, drug–drug interactions,
  drug–food interactions and many other relevant data types for 11~891 drugs. We have
  also added experimental and predicted MS/MS spectra, 1D/2D-NMR spectra, CCS (collision
  cross section), RT (retention time)~and RI (retention index) data for 9464 of DrugBank's
  11~710 small molecule drugs. These and other improvements should make DrugBank 6.0
  even more useful to a much wider research audience ranging from medicinal chemists
  to metabolomics specialists to pharmacologists.
