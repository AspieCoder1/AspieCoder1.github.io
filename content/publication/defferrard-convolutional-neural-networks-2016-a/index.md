abstract: In this work, we are interested in generalizing convolutional neural networks
  (CNNs) from low-dimensional regular grids, where image, video and speech are represented,
  to high-dimensional irregular domains, such as social networks, brain connectomes
  or words’ embedding, represented by graphs. We present a formulation of CNNs in
  the context of spectral graph theory, which provides the necessary mathematical
  background and efficient numerical schemes to design fast localized convolutional
  filters on graphs. Importantly, the proposed technique offers the same linear computational
  complexity and constant learning complexity as classical CNNs, while being universal
  to any graph structure. Experiments on MNIST and 20NEWS demonstrate the ability
  of this novel deep learning system to learn local, stationary, and compositional
  features on graphs.
