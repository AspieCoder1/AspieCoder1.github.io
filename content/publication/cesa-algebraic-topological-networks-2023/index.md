abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel approach based on algebraic topology
  to enhance graph convolution and attention modules by incorporating local topological
  properties of the data. To do so, we consider the framework of sheaf neural networks,
  which has been previously leveraged to incorporate additional structure into graph
  neural networks' features and construct more expressive, non-isotropic messages.
  Specifically, given an input simplicial complex (e.g. generated by the cliques of
  a graph or the neighbors in a point cloud), we construct its local homology sheaf,
  which assigns to each node the vector space of its local homology. The intermediate
  features of our networks live in these vector spaces and we leverage the associated
  sheaf Laplacian to construct more complex linear messages between them. Moreover,
  we extend this approach by considering the persistent version of local homology
  associated with a weighted simplicial complex (e.g., built from pairwise distances
  of nodes embeddings). This i) solves the problem of the lack of a natural choice
  of basis for the local homology vector spaces and ii) makes the sheaf itself differentiable,
  which enables our models to directly optimize the topology of their intermediate
  features.
