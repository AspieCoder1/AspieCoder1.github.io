abstract: 'At initialization, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are equivalent to
  Gaussian processes in the infinite-width limit, thus connecting them to kernel methods.
  We prove that the evolution of an ANN during training can also be described by a
  kernel: during gradient descent on the parameters of an ANN, the network function
  (which maps input vectors to output vectors) follows the so-called kernel gradient
  associated with a new object, which we call the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This
  kernel is central to describe the generalization features of ANNs. While the NTK
  is random at initialization and varies during training, in the infinite-width limit
  it converges to an explicit limiting kernel and stays constant during training.
  This makes it possible to study the training of ANNs in function space instead of
  parameter space. Convergence of the training can then be related to the positive-definiteness
  of the limiting NTK.'
