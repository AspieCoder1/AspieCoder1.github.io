abstract: 'Machine learning-based program analyses have recently shown the promise
  of integrating formal and probabilistic reasoning towards aiding software development.
  However, in the absence of large annotated corpora, training these analyses is challenging.
  Towards addressing this, we present BugLab, an approach for self-supervised learning
  of bug detection and repair.  BugLab co-trains two models: (1) a detector model
  that learns to detect and repair bugs in code, (2) a selector model that learns
  to create buggy code for the detector to use as training data. A Python implementation
  of BugLab improves by 30% upon baseline methods on a test dataset of 2374 real-life
  bugs and finds 19 previously unknown bugs in open-source software.'
