abstract: The coronavirus disease, named COVID-19, has become the largest global public
  health crisis since it started in early 2020. CT imaging has been used as a complementary
  tool to assist early screening, especially for the rapid identification of COVID-19
  cases from community acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases. The main challenge in early
  screening is how to model the confusing cases in the COVID-19 and CAP groups, with
  very similar clinical manifestations and imaging features. To tackle this challenge,
  we propose an Uncertainty Vertex-weighted Hypergraph Learning (UVHL) method to identify
  COVID-19 from CAP using CT images. In particular, multiple types of features (including
  regional features and radiomics features) are first extracted from CT image for
  each case. Then, the relationship among different cases is formulated by a hypergraph
  structure, with each case represented as a vertex in the hypergraph. The uncertainty
  of each vertex is further computed with an uncertainty score measurement and used
  as a weight in the hypergraph. Finally, a learning process of the vertex-weighted
  hypergraph is used to predict whether a new testing case belongs to COVID-19 or
  not. Experiments on a large multi-center pneumonia dataset, consisting of 2148 COVID-19
  cases and 1182 CAP cases from five hospitals, are conducted to evaluate the prediction
  accuracy of the proposed method. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness
  of our proposed method on the identification of COVID-19 in comparison to state-of-the-art
  methods.
