abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) medical images are prone to overlap, and there are
  some problems, such as low detection efficiency and inconsistent with the actual
  situation. Therefore, a 3D medical image surface reconstruction method based on
  data mining and machine learning is proposed. The 3D medical images were classified
  according to different ways, the information frame of 3D medical images was established
  and the surface overlapping information model of 3D images was given. Based on this
  information framework, the nonlinear function of overlapping area information of
  3D medical images was constructed. The weight of the nonlinear function was used
  to calculate the input and output results of overlapping area information. Combined
  with the input mode of 3D medical image information, the error between the information
  output and the expected output was set. The nonlinear function weight of the overlapping
  area information of 3D medical images was modified by using the learning rate and
  the use time of the overlapping area information, and the influence factors of the
  overlapping information detection were obtained by increasing the situation terms,
  so as to complete the detection of the surface reconstruction information of 3D
  medical images. The experimental results show that the information detection results
  of the proposed method fit well with the actual situation, and the information detection
  efficiency is high.
