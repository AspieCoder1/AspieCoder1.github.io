 abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) medical images are prone to overlap, and there are some problems, such as low detection efficiency and inconsistent with the actual situation. Therefore, a 3D medical image surface reconstruction method based on data mining and machine learning is proposed. The 3D medical images were classified according to different ways, the information frame of 3D medical images was established and the surface overlapping information model of 3D images was given. Based on this information framework, the nonlinear function of overlapping area information of 3D medical images was constructed. The weight of the nonlinear function was used to calculate the input and output results of overlapping area information. Combined with the input mode of 3D medical image information, the error between the information output and the expected output was set. The nonlinear function weight of the overlapping area information of 3D medical images was modified by using the learning rate and the use time of the overlapping area information, and the influence factors of the overlapping information detection were obtained by increasing the situation terms, so as to complete the detection of the surface reconstruction information of 3D medical images. The experimental results show that the information detection results of the proposed method fit well with the actual situation, and the information detection efficiency is high.},
