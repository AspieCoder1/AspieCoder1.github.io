abstract: 'Knowledge graphs enable a wide variety of applications, including question
  answering and information retrieval. Despite the great effort invested in their
  creation and maintenance, even the largest (e.g., Yago, DBPedia or Wikidata) remain
  incomplete. We introduce Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs) and apply
  them to two standard knowledge base completion tasks: Link prediction (recovery
  of missing facts, i.e.~subject-predicate-object triples) and entity classification
  (recovery of missing entity attributes). R-GCNs are related to a recent class of
  neural networks operating on graphs, and are developed specifically to handle the
  highly multi-relational data characteristic of realistic knowledge bases. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of R-GCNs as a stand-alone model for entity classification. We
  further show that factorization models for link prediction such as DistMult can
  be significantly improved through the use of an R-GCN encoder model to accumulate
  evidence over multiple inference steps in the graph, demonstrating a large improvement
  of 29.8% on FB15k-237 over a decoder-only baseline.'
