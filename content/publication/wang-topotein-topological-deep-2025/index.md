abstract: Protein representation learning (PRL) is crucial for understanding structure-function
  relationships, yet current sequence- and graph-based methods fail to capture the
  hierarchical organization inherent in protein structures. We introduce Topotein,
  a comprehensive framework that applies topological deep learning to PRL through
  the novel Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) and Topology-Complete Perceptron Network
  (TCPNet). Our PCC represents proteins at multiple hierarchical levels -- from residues
  to secondary structures to complete proteins -- while preserving geometric information
  at each level. TCPNet employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical
  structures, enabling more effective capture of multi-scale structural patterns.
  Through extensive experiments on four PRL tasks, TCPNet consistently outperforms
  state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks. Our approach demonstrates particular
  strength in tasks such as fold classification which require understanding of secondary
  structure arrangements, validating the importance of hierarchical topological features
  for protein analysis.
