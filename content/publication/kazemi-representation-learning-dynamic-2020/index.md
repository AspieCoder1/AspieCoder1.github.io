abstract: Graphs arise naturally in many real-world applications including social
  networks, recommender systems, ontologies, biology, and computational finance. Traditionally,
  machine learning models for graphs have been mostly designed for static graphs.
  However, many applications involve evolving graphs. This introduces important challenges
  for learning and inference since nodes, attributes, and edges change over time.
  In this survey, we review the recent advances in representation learning for dynamic
  graphs, including dynamic knowledge graphs. We describe existing models from an
  encoder-decoder perspective, categorize these encoders and decoders based on the
  techniques they employ, and analyze the approaches in each category. We also review
  several prominent applications and widely used datasets and highlight directions
  for future research.
