abstract: We present Deep Graph Infomax (DGI), a general approach for learning node
  representations within graph-structured data in an unsupervised manner. DGI relies
  on maximizing mutual information between patch representations and corresponding
  high-level summaries of graphs---both derived using established graph convolutional
  network architectures. The learnt patch representations summarize subgraphs centered
  around nodes of interest, and can thus be reused for downstream node-wise learning
  tasks. In contrast to most prior approaches to unsupervised learning with GCNs,
  DGI does not rely on random walk objectives, and is readily applicable to both transductive
  and inductive learning setups. We demonstrate competitive performance on a variety
  of node classification benchmarks, which at times even exceeds the performance of
  supervised learning.
