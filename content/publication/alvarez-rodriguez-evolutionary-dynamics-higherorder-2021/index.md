abstract: We live and cooperate in networks. However, links in networks only allow
  for pairwise interactions, thus making the framework suitable for dyadic games,
  but not for games that are played in larger groups. Here, we study the evolutionary
  dynamics of a public goods game in social systems with higher-order interactions.
  First, we show that the game on uniform hypergraphs corresponds to the replicator
  dynamics in the well-mixed limit, providing a formal theoretical foundation to study
  cooperation in networked groups. Second, we unveil how the presence of hubs and
  the coexistence of interactions in groups of different sizes affects the evolution
  of cooperation. Finally, we apply the proposed framework to extract the actual dependence
  of the synergy factor on the size of a group from real-world collaboration data
  in science and technology. Our work provides a way to implement informed actions
  to boost cooperation in social groups.
