abstract: Many underlying relationships among data in several areas of science and
  engineering, e.g., computer vision, molecular chemistry, molecular biology, pattern
  recognition, and data mining, can be represented in terms of graphs. In this paper,
  we propose a new neural network model, called graph neural network (GNN) model,
  that extends existing neural network methods for processing the data represented
  in graph domains. This GNN model, which can directly process most of the practically
  useful types of graphs, e.g., acyclic, cyclic, directed, and undirected, implements
  a function tau(G,n) isin IRm that maps a graph G and one of its nodes n into an
  m-dimensional Euclidean space. A supervised learning algorithm is derived to estimate
  the parameters of the proposed GNN model. The computational cost of the proposed
  algorithm is also considered. Some experimental results are shown to validate the
  proposed learning algorithm, and to demonstrate its generalization capabilities.
