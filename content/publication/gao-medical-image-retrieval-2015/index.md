abstract: "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder
  that can lead to progressive memory loss and cognition impairment. Therefore, diagnosing
  AD during the risk stage, a.k.a. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), has attracted
  ever increasing interest. Besides the automated diagnosis of MCI, it is important
  to provide physicians with related MCI cases with visually similar imaging data
  for case-based reasoning or evidence-based medicine in clinical practices. To this
  end, we propose a multi-graph learning based medical image retrieval technique for
  MCI diagnostic assistance. Our method is comprised of two stages, the query category
  prediction and ranking. In the first stage, the query is formulated into a multi-graph
  structure with a set of selected subjects in the database to learn the relevance
  between the query subject and the existing subject categories through learning the
  multi-graph combination weights. This predicts the category that the query belongs
  to, based on which a set of subjects in the database are selected as candidate retrieval
  results. In the second stage, the relationship between these candidates and the
  query is further learned with a new multi-graph, which is used to rank the candidates.
  The returned subjects can be demonstrated to physicians as reference cases for MCI
  diagnosing. We evaluated the proposed method on a cohort of 60 consecutive MCI subjects
  and 350 normal controls with MRI data under three imaging parameters: T1 weighted
  imaging (T1), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL). The
  proposed method can achieve average 3.45 relevant samples in top 5 returned results,
  which significantly outperforms the baseline methods compared."
