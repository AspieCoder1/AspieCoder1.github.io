abstract: Compile-time errors pose a major learning hurdle for students of introductory
  programming courses. Compiler error messages, while accurate, are targeted at seasoned
  programmers, and seem cryptic to beginners. In this work, we address this problem
  of pedagogically-inspired program repair and report TRACER (Targeted RepAir of Compilation
  ERrors), a system for performing repairs on compilation errors, aimed at introductory
  programmers. TRACER invokes a novel combination of tools from programming language
  theory and deep learning and offers repairs that not only enable successful compilation,
  but repairs that are very close to those actually performed by students on similar
  errors. The ability to offer such targeted corrections, rather than just code that
  compiles, makes TRACER more relevant in offering real-time feedback to students
  in lab or tutorial sessions, as compared to existing works that merely offer a certain
  compilation success rate. In an evaluation on 4500 erroneous C programs written
  by students of a freshman year programming course, TRACER recommends a repair exactly
  matching the one expected by the student for 68% of the cases, and in 79.27% of
  the cases, produces a compilable repair. On a further set of 6971 programs that
  require errors to be fixed on multiple lines, TRACER enjoyed a success rate of 44%
  compared to the 27% success rate offered by the state-of-the-art technique DeepFix.
