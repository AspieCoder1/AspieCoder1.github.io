abstract: Hypergraphs allow one to encode higher-order relationships in data and are
  thus a very flexible modeling tool. Current learning methods are either based on
  approximations of the hypergraphs via graphs or on tensor methods which are only
  applicable under special conditions. In this paper, we present a new learning framework
  on hypergraphs which fully uses the hypergraph structure. The key element is a family
  of regularization functionals based on the total variation on hypergraphs.
