abstract: Hypergraphs provide a natural representation for many real world datasets.
  We propose a novel framework, HNHN, for hypergraph representation learning. HNHN
  is a hypergraph convolution network with nonlinear activation functions applied
  to both hypernodes and hyperedges, combined with a normalization scheme that can
  flexibly adjust the importance of high-cardinality hyperedges and high-degree vertices
  depending on the dataset. We demonstrate improved performance of HNHN in both classification
  accuracy and speed on real world datasets when compared to state of the art methods.
