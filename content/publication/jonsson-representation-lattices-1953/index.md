abstract: 'Whitman has shown that every lattice A is isomorphic to a lattice 𝒜 of
  equivalence relations. If for every R and S in 𝒜 the relative product R; S; R; S;...
  with n+1 factors is an equivalence relation, and hence equal to the lattice sum
  of R and S, then we speak of a representation of A of type n. Results: 1° Every
  lattice A has a representation of type 3. 2° In order for A to have a representation
  of type 2, it is necessary and sufficient that A be modular. 3° There exist modular
  lattices which do not have a representation of type 1 (a representation by commuting
  equivalence relations).'
