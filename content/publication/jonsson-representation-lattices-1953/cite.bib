 abstract = {Whitman has shown that every lattice A is isomorphic to a lattice 𝒜 of equivalence relations. If for every R and S in 𝒜 the relative product R; S; R; S;... with n+1 factors is an equivalence relation, and hence equal to the lattice sum of R and S, then we speak of a representation of A of type n. Results: 1° Every lattice A has a representation of type 3. 2° In order for A to have a representation of type 2, it is necessary and sufficient that A be modular. 3° There exist modular lattices which do not have a representation of type 1 (a representation by commuting equivalence relations).},
