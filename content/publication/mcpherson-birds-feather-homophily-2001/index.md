abstract: 'Similarity breeds connection. This principle—the homophily principle—structures
  network ties of every type, including marriage, friendship, work, advice, support,
  information transfer, exchange, comembership, and other types of relationship. The
  result is that people&apos;s personal networks are homogeneous with regard to many
  sociodemographic, behavioral, and intrapersonal characteristics. Homophily limits
  people&apos;s social worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the information
  they receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience. Homophily
  in race and ethnicity creates the strongest divides in our personal environments,
  with age, religion, education, occupation, and gender following in roughly that
  order. Geographic propinquity, families, organizations, and isomorphic positions
  in social systems all create contexts in which homophilous relations form. Ties
  between nonsimilar individuals also dissolve at a higher rate, which sets the stage
  for the formation of niches (localized positions) within social space. We argue
  for more research on: (a) the basic ecological processes that link organizations,
  associations, cultural communities, social movements, and many other social forms;
  (b) the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of homophily; and (c) the dynamics
  of network change over time through which networks and other social entities co-evolve.'
