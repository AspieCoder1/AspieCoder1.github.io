abstract: "The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science
  and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional
  learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision,
  playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational
  scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic
  principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted,
  often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each
  task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented
  as backpropagation. While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed
  estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential
  pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure
  of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through
  unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications.
  Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen
  Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework
  to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs,
  and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate
  prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to
  build future architectures yet to be invented."
