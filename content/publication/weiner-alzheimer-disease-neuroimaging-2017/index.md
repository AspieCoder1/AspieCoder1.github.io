abstract: "INTRODUCTION: The overall goal of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
  Initiative (ADNI) is to validate biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical
  trials. ADNI-3, which began on August 1, 2016, is a 5-year renewal of the current
  ADNI-2 study. METHODS: ADNI-3 will follow current and additional subjects with normal
  cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and AD using innovative technologies such
  as tau imaging, magnetic resonance imaging sequences for connectivity analyses,
  and a highly automated immunoassay platform and mass spectroscopy approach for cerebrospinal
  fluid biomarker analysis. A Systems Biology/pathway approach will be used to identify
  genetic factors for subject selection/enrichment. Amyloid positron emission tomography
  scanning will be standardized using the Centiloid method. The Brain Health Registry
  will help recruit subjects and monitor subject cognition. RESULTS: Multimodal analyses
  will provide insight into AD pathophysiology and disease progression. DISCUSSION:
  ADNI-3 will aim to inform AD treatment trials and facilitate development of AD disease-modifying
  treatments."
