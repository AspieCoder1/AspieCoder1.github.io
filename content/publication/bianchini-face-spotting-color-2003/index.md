abstract: Images containing faces are fundamental for vision– based human computer
  interaction. Several problems concerning the presence of faces in images, including
  face recognition, pose estimation, and expression recognition have focused the research
  efforts in the last few years. Moreover, those problems are usually solved having
  assumed that the face was previously localized, often via heuristics based on prototypes
  of the whole face or significant details. Therefore, each fully automated system,
  which is able to analyze the information contained in images of faces, requires
  an efficient face localization method. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
  to the solution of the face localization problem using recursive neural networks.
  In particular, the proposed approach assumes a graph–based representation of images
  that combines structural and sub–symbolic visual features. Each image is represented
  by a forest of trees. Such trees are then processed by recursive neural networks,
  in order to establish the eventual presence and the position of faces inside the
  image. Some preliminary experiments on snapshots from video sequences are reported,
  showing very promising results.
