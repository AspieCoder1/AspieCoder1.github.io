abstract: The advancements in machine learning techniques have encouraged researchers
  to apply these techniques to a myriad of software engineering tasks that use source
  code analysis, such as testing and vulnerability detection. Such a large number
  of studies hinders the community from understanding the current research landscape.
  This paper aims to summarize the current knowledge in applied machine learning for
  source code analysis. We review studies belonging to twelve categories of software
  engineering tasks and corresponding machine learning techniques, tools, and datasets
  that have been applied to solve them. To do so, we conducted an extensive literature
  search and identified 479 primary studies published between 2011 and 2021. We summarize
  our observations and findings with the help of the identified studies. Our findings
  suggest that the use of machine learning techniques for source code analysis tasks
  is consistently increasing. We synthesize commonly used steps and the overall workflow
  for each task and summarize machine learning techniques employed. We identify a
  comprehensive list of available datasets and tools useable in this context. Finally,
  the paper discusses perceived challenges in this area, including the availability
  of standard datasets, reproducibility and replicability, and hardware resources.
