abstract: 'Network embedding (or graph embedding) has been widely used in many real-world
  applications. However, existing methods mainly focus on networks with single-typed
  nodes/edges and cannot scale well to handle large networks. Many real-world networks
  consist of billions of nodes and edges of multiple types, and each node is associated
  with different attributes. In this paper, we formalize the problem of embedding
  learning for the Attributed Multiplex Heterogeneous Network and propose a unified
  framework to address this problem. The framework supports both transductive and
  inductive learning. We also give the theoretical analysis of the proposed framework,
  showing its connection with previous works and proving its better expressiveness.
  We conduct systematical evaluations for the proposed framework on four different
  genres of challenging datasets: Amazon, YouTube, Twitter, and Alibaba. Experimental
  results demonstrate that with the learned embeddings from the proposed framework,
  we can achieve statistically significant improvements (e.g., 5.99-28.23% lift by
  F1 scores; p&lt;&lt;0.01, t-test) over previous state-of-the-art methods for link
  prediction. The framework has also been successfully deployed on the recommendation
  system of a worldwide leading e-commerce company, Alibaba Group. Results of the
  offline A/B tests on product recommendation further confirm the effectiveness and
  efficiency of the framework in practice.'
