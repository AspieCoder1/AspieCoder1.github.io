abstract: We introduce a novel class of Laplacians and diffusion dynamics on discourse
  sheaves as a model for network dynamics, with application to opinion dynamics on
  social networks. These sheaves are algebraic data structures tethered to a network
  (or more general space) that can represent various modes of communication, including
  selective opinion modulation and lying. After introducing the sheaf model, we develop
  a sheaf Laplacian in this context and show how to evolve both opinions and communications
  with diffusion dynamics over the network. Issues of controllability, reachability,
  bounded confidence, and harmonic extension are addressed using this framework.
