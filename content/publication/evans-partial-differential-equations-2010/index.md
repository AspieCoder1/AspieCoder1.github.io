abstract: "\\\"This is the second edition of the now definitive text on partial differential
  equations (PDE). It offers a comprehensive survey of modern techniques in the theoretical
  study of PDE with particular emphasis on nonlinear equations. Its wide scope and
  clear exposition make it a great text for a graduate course in PDE. For this edition,
  the author has made numerous changes, including: a new chapter on nonlinear wave
  equations, more than 80 new exercises, several new sections, and a significantly
  expanded bibliography.\\\"--Publisher's description."
