 abstract = {A main object of our study is multiset functions -- that is, permutation-invariant functions over inputs of varying sizes. Deep Sets, proposed by \ cite\zaheer2017deep\, provides a \ emph\universal representation\ for continuous multiset functions on scalars via a sum-decomposable model. Restricting the domain of the functions to finite multisets of \$D\$-dimensional vectors, Deep Sets also provides a \ emph\universal approximation\ that requires a latent space dimension of \$O(N\textasciicircum D)\$ -- where \$N\$ is an upper bound on the size of input multisets. In this paper, we strengthen this result by proving that universal representation is guaranteed for continuous and discontinuous multiset functions though a latent space dimension of \$O(N\textasciicircum D)\$. We then introduce \ emph\identifiable\ multisets for which we can uniquely label their elements using an identifier function, namely, finite-precision vectors are identifiable. Using our analysis on identifiable multisets, we prove that a sum-decomposable model for general continuous multiset functions only requires a latent dimension of \$2DN\$. We further show that both encoder and decoder functions of the model are continuous -- our main contribution to the existing work which lack such a guarantee. Also this provides a significant improvement over the aforementioned \$O(N\textasciicircum D)\$ bound which was derived for universal representation of continuous and discontinuous multiset functions. We then extend our results and provide special sum-decomposition structures to universally represent permutation-invariant tensor functions on identifiable tensors. These families of sum-decomposition models enables us to design deep network architectures and deploy them on a variety of learning tasks on sequences, images, and graphs.},
