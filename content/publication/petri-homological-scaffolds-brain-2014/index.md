abstract: Networks, as efficient representations of complex systems, have appealed
  to scientists for a long time and now permeate many areas of science, including
  neuroimaging (Bullmore and Sporns 2009 Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 10, 186–198. (doi:10.1038/nrn2618)).
  Traditionally, the structure of complex networks has been studied through their
  statistical properties and metrics concerned with node and link properties, e.g.
  degree-distribution, node centrality and modularity. Here, we study the characteristics
  of functional brain networks at the mesoscopic level from a novel perspective that
  highlights the role of inhomogeneities in the fabric of functional connections.
  This can be done by focusing on the features of a set of topological objects—homological
  cycles—associated with the weighted functional network. We leverage the detected
  topological information to define the homological scaffolds, a new set of objects
  designed to represent compactly the homological features of the correlation network
  and simultaneously make their homological properties amenable to networks theoretical
  methods. As a proof of principle, we apply these tools to compare resting-state
  functional brain activity in 15 healthy volunteers after intravenous infusion of
  placebo and psilocybin—the main psychoactive component of magic mushrooms. The results
  show that the homological structure of the brain's functional patterns undergoes
  a dramatic change post-psilocybin, characterized by the appearance of many transient
  structures of low stability and of a small number of persistent ones that are not
  observed in the case of placebo.
