abstract: 'Interacting systems are prevalent in nature, from dynamical systems in
  physics to complex societal dynamics. The interplay of components can give rise
  to complex behavior, which can often be explained using a simple model of the systemâ€™s
  constituent parts. In this work, we introduce the neural relational inference (NRI)
  model: an unsupervised model that learns to infer interactions while simultaneously
  learning the dynamics purely from observational data. Our model takes the form of
  a variational auto-encoder, in which the latent code represents the underlying interaction
  graph and the reconstruction is based on graph neural networks. In experiments on
  simulated physical systems, we show that our NRI model can accurately recover ground-truth
  interactions in an unsupervised manner. We further demonstrate that we can find
  an interpretable structure and predict complex dynamics in real motion capture and
  sports tracking data.'
