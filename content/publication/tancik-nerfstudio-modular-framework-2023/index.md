abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are a rapidly growing area of research with
  wide-ranging applications in computer vision, graphics, robotics, and more. In order
  to streamline the development and deployment of NeRF research, we propose a modular
  PyTorch framework, Nerfstudio. Our framework includes plug-and-play components for
  implementing NeRF-based methods, which make it easy for researchers and practitioners
  to incorporate NeRF into their projects. Additionally, the modular design enables
  support for extensive real-time visualization tools, streamlined pipelines for importing
  captured in-the-wild data, and tools for exporting to video, point cloud and mesh
  representations. The modularity of Nerfstudio enables the development of Nerfacto,
  our method that combines components from recent papers to achieve a balance between
  speed and quality, while also remaining flexible to future modifications. To promote
  community-driven development, all associated code and data are made publicly available
  with open-source licensing.
