 abstract = {Early detection of Alzheimer's disease's precursor stages is imperative for significantly enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life. This challenge is tackled through a semi-supervised multi-modal diagnosis framework. In particular, we introduce a new hypergraph framework that enables higher-order relations between multi-modal data, while utilising minimal labels. We first introduce a bilevel hypergraph optimisation framework that jointly learns a graph augmentation policy and a semi-supervised classifier. This dual learning strategy is hypothesised to enhance the robustness and generalisation capabilities of the model by fostering new pathways for information propagation. Secondly, we introduce a novel strategy for generating pseudo-labels more effectively via a gradient-driven flow. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our framework over current techniques in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease.},
