abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease's precursor stages is imperative
  for significantly enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life. This challenge
  is tackled through a semi-supervised multi-modal diagnosis framework. In particular,
  we introduce a new hypergraph framework that enables higher-order relations between
  multi-modal data, while utilising minimal labels. We first introduce a bilevel hypergraph
  optimisation framework that jointly learns a graph augmentation policy and a semi-supervised
  classifier. This dual learning strategy is hypothesised to enhance the robustness
  and generalisation capabilities of the model by fostering new pathways for information
  propagation. Secondly, we introduce a novel strategy for generating pseudo-labels
  more effectively via a gradient-driven flow. Our experimental results demonstrate
  the superior performance of our framework over current techniques in diagnosing
  Alzheimer's disease.
