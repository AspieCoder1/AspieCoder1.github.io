abstract: Neural networks have a reputation for being better at solving statistical
  or approximate problems than at performing calculations or working with symbolic
  data. In this paper, we show that they can be surprisingly good at more elaborated
  tasks in mathematics, such as symbolic integration and solving differential equations.
  We propose a syntax for representing mathematical problems, and methods for generating
  large datasets that can be used to train sequence-to-sequence models. We achieve
  results that outperform commercial Computer Algebra Systems such as Matlab or Mathematica.
