abstract: A key requirement for graph neural networks is that they must process a
  graph in a way that does not depend on how the graph is described. Traditionally
  this has been taken to mean that a graph network must be equivariant to node permutations.
  Here we show that instead of equivariance, the more general concept of naturality
  is sufficient for a graph network to be well-defined, opening up a larger class
  of graph networks. We define global and local natural graph networks, the latter
  of which are as scalable as conventional message passing graph neural networks while
  being more flexible. We give one practical instantiation of a natural network on
  graphs which uses an equivariant message network parameterization, yielding good
  performance on several benchmarks.
