abstract: 'The practice of mathematics involves discovering patterns and using these
  to formulate and prove conjectures, resulting in theorems. Since the 1960s, mathematicians
  have used computers to assist in the discovery of patterns and formulation of conjectures1,
  most famously in the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture2, a Millennium Prize Problem3.
  Here we provide examples of new fundamental results in pure mathematics that have
  been discovered with the assistance of machine learning—demonstrating a method by
  which machine learning can aid mathematicians in discovering new conjectures and
  theorems. We propose a process of using machine learning to discover potential patterns
  and relations between mathematical objects, understanding them with attribution
  techniques and using these observations to guide intuition and propose conjectures.
  We outline this machine-learning-guided framework and demonstrate its successful
  application to current research questions in distinct areas of pure mathematics,
  in each case showing how it led to meaningful mathematical contributions on important
  open problems: a new connection between the algebraic and geometric structure of
  knots, and a candidate algorithm predicted by the combinatorial invariance conjecture
  for symmetric groups4. Our work may serve as a model for collaboration between the
  fields of mathematics and artificial intelligence (AI) that can achieve surprising
  results by leveraging the respective strengths of mathematicians and machine learning.'
