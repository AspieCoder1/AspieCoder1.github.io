abstract: We present a generalization of graph convolutional networks by generalizing
  the diffusion operation underlying this class of graph neural networks. These sheaf
  neural networks are based on the sheaf Laplacian, a generalization of the graph
  Laplacian that encodes additional relational structure parameterized by the underlying
  graph. The sheaf Laplacian and associated matrices provide an extended version of
  the diffusion operation in graph convolutional networks, providing a proper generalization
  for domains where relations between nodes are non-constant, asymmetric, and varying
  in dimension. We show that the resulting sheaf neural networks can outperform graph
  convolutional networks in domains where relations between nodes are asymmetric and
  signed.
