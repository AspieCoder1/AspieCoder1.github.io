abstract: We present a scalable approach for semi-supervised learning on graph-structured
  data that is based on an efficient variant of convolutional neural networks which
  operate directly on graphs. We motivate the choice of our convolutional architecture
  via a localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions. Our model
  scales linearly in the number of graph edges and learns hidden layer representations
  that encode both local graph structure and features of nodes. In a number of experiments
  on citation networks and on a knowledge graph dataset we demonstrate that our approach
  outperforms related methods by a significant margin.
