abstract: Since real-world objects and their interactions are often multi-modal and
  multi-typed, heterogeneous networks have been widely used as a more powerful, realistic,
  and generic superclass of traditional homogeneous networks (graphs). Meanwhile,
  representation learning (&lt;italic&gt;a.k.a.&lt;/italic&gt; embedding) has recently
  been intensively studied and shown effective for various network mining and analytical
  tasks. In this work, we aim to provide a unified framework to deeply summarize and
  evaluate existing research on heterogeneous network embedding (HNE), which includes
  but goes beyond a normal survey. Since there has already been a broad body of HNE
  algorithms, as the first contribution of this article, we provide a generic paradigm
  for the systematic categorization and analysis over the merits of various existing
  HNE algorithms. Moreover, existing HNE algorithms, though mostly claimed generic,
  are often evaluated on different datasets. Understandable due to the application
  favor of HNE, such indirect comparisons largely hinder the proper attribution of
  improved task performance towards effective data preprocessing and novel technical
  design, especially considering the various ways possible to construct a heterogeneous
  network from real-world application data. Therefore, as the second contribution,
  we create four benchmark datasets with various properties regarding scale, structure,
  attribute/label availability, and &lt;italic&gt;etc&lt;/italic&gt;. from different
  sources, towards handy and fair evaluations of HNE algorithms. As the third contribution,
  we carefully refactor and amend the implementations and create friendly interfaces
  for 13 popular HNE algorithms, and provide all-around comparisons among them over
  multiple tasks and experimental settings. By putting all existing HNE algorithms
  under a unified framework, we aim to provide a universal reference and guideline
  for the understanding and development of HNE algorithms. Meanwhile, by open-sourcing
  all data and code, we envision to serve the community with an ready-to-use benchmark
  platform to test and compare the performance of existing and future HNE algorithms
