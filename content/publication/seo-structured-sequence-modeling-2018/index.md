abstract: 'This paper introduces Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (GCRN), a deep
  learning model able to predict structured sequences of data. Precisely, GCRN is
  a generalization of classical recurrent neural networks (RNN) to data structured
  by an arbitrary graph. The structured sequences can represent series of frames in
  videos, spatio-temporal measurements on a network of sensors, or random walks on
  a vocabulary graph for natural language modeling. The proposed model combines convolutional
  neural networks (CNN) on graphs to identify spatial structures and RNN to find dynamic
  patterns. We study two possible architectures of GCRN, and apply the models to two
  practical problems: predicting moving MNIST data, and modeling natural language
  with the Penn Treebank dataset. Experiments show that exploiting simultaneously
  graph spatial and dynamic information about data can improve both precision and
  learning speed.'
