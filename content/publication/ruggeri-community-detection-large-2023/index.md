abstract: Hypergraphs, describing networks where interactions take place among any
  number of units, are a natural tool to model many real-world social and biological
  systems. In this work we propose a principled framework to model the organization
  of higher-order data. Our approach recovers community structure with accuracy exceeding
  that of currently available state-of-the-art algorithms, as tested in synthetic
  benchmarks with both hard and overlapping ground-truth partitions. Our model is
  flexible and allows capturing both assortative and disassortative community structures.
  Moreover, our method scales orders of magnitude faster than competing algorithms,
  making it suitable for the analysis of very large hypergraphs, containing millions
  of nodes and interactions among thousands of nodes. Our work constitutes a practical
  and general tool for hypergraph analysis, broadening our understanding of the organization
  of real-world higher-order systems.
