abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have become increasingly popular to support
  clinical decision-making and healthcare in recent decades. EHRs usually contain
  heterogeneous information, such as structural data in tabular form and unstructured
  data in textual notes. Different types of information in EHRs can complement each
  other and provide a more complete picture of the health status of a patient. While
  there has been a lot of research on representation learning of structured EHR data,
  the fusion of different types of EHR data (multimodal fusion) is not well studied.
  This is mostly because of the complex medical coding systems used and the noise
  and redundancy present in the written notes. In this work, we propose a new framework
  called MINGLE, which integrates both structures and semantics in EHR effectively.
  Our framework uses a two-level infusion strategy to combine medical concept semantics
  and clinical note semantics into hypergraph neural networks, which learn the complex
  interactions between different types of data to generate visit representations for
  downstream prediction. Experiment results on two EHR datasets, the public MIMIC-III
  and private CRADLE, show that MINGLE can effectively improve predictive performance
  by 11.83% relatively, enhancing semantic integration as well as multimodal fusion
  for structural and textual EHR data.
