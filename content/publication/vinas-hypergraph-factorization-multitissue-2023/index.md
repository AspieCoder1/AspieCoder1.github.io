abstract: Integrating gene expression across tissues and cell types is crucial for
  understanding the coordinated biological mechanisms that drive disease and characterize
  homoeostasis. However, traditional multi-tissue integration methods either cannot
  handle uncollected tissues or rely on genotype information, which is often unavailable
  and subject to privacy concerns. Here we present HYFA (hypergraph factorization),
  a parameter-efficient graph representation learning approach for joint imputation
  of multi-tissue and cell-type gene expression. HYFA is genotype agnostic, supports
  a variable number of collected tissues per individual, and imposes strong inductive
  biases to leverage the shared regulatory architecture of tissues and genes. In performance
  comparison on Genotype–Tissue Expression project data, HYFA achieves superior performance
  over existing methods, especially when multiple reference tissues are available.
  The HYFA-imputed dataset can be used to identify replicable regulatory genetic variations
  (expression quantitative trait loci), with substantial gains over the original incomplete
  dataset. HYFA can accelerate the effective and scalable integration of tissue and
  cell-type transcriptome biorepositories.
