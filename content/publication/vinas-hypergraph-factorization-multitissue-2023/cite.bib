 abstract = {Integrating gene expression across tissues and cell types is crucial for understanding the coordinated biological mechanisms that drive disease and characterize homoeostasis. However, traditional multi-tissue integration methods either cannot handle uncollected tissues or rely on genotype information, which is often unavailable and subject to privacy concerns. Here we present HYFA (hypergraph factorization), a parameter-efficient graph representation learning approach for joint imputation of multi-tissue and cell-type gene expression. HYFA is genotype agnostic, supports a variable number of collected tissues per individual, and imposes strong inductive biases to leverage the shared regulatory architecture of tissues and genes. In performance comparison on Genotype–Tissue Expression project data, HYFA achieves superior performance over existing methods, especially when multiple reference tissues are available. The HYFA-imputed dataset can be used to identify replicable regulatory genetic variations (expression quantitative trait loci), with substantial gains over the original incomplete dataset. HYFA can accelerate the effective and scalable integration of tissue and cell-type transcriptome biorepositories.},
