abstract: Despite recent progress in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), explaining predictions
  made by GNNs remains a challenging open problem. The leading method mainly addresses
  the local explanations (i.e., important subgraph structure and node features) to
  interpret why a GNN model makes the prediction for a single instance, e.g. a node
  or a graph. As a result, the explanation generated is painstakingly customized for
  each instance. The unique explanation interpreting each instance independently is
  not sufficient to provide a global understanding of the learned GNN model, leading
  to the lack of generalizability and hindering it from being used in the inductive
  setting. Besides, as it is designed for explaining a single instance, it is challenging
  to explain a set of instances naturally (e.g., graphs of a given class). In this
  study, we address these key challenges and propose PGExplainer, a parameterized
  explainer for GNNs. PGExplainer adopts a deep neural network to parameterize the
  generation process of explanations, which enables PGExplainer a natural approach
  to multi-instance explanations. Compared to the existing work, PGExplainer has a
  better generalization power and can be utilized in an inductive setting easily.
  Experiments on both synthetic and real-life datasets show highly competitive performance
  with up to 24.7% relative improvement in AUC on explaining graph classification
  over the leading baseline.
