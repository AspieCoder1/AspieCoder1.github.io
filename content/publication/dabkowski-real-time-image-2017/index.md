abstract: In this work we develop a fast saliency detection method that can be applied
  to any differentiable image classifier. We train a masking model to manipulate the
  scores of the classifier by masking salient parts of the input image. Our model
  generalises well to unseen images and requires a single forward pass to perform
  saliency detection, therefore suitable for use in real-time systems. We test our
  approach on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets and show that the produced saliency maps
  are easily interpretable, sharp, and free of artifacts. We suggest a new metric
  for saliency and test our method on the ImageNet object localisation task. We achieve
  results outperforming other weakly supervised methods.
