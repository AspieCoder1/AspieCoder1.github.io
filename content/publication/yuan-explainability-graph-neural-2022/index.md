abstract: Deep learning methods are achieving ever-increasing performance on many
  artificial intelligence tasks. A major limitation of deep models is that they are
  not amenable to interpretability. This limitation can be circumvented by developing
  post hoc techniques to explain the predictions, giving rise to the area of explainability.
  Recently, explainability of deep models on images and texts has achieved significant
  progress. In the area of graph data, graph neural networks (GNNs) and their explainability
  are experiencing rapid developments. However, there is neither a unified treatment
  of GNN explainability methods, nor a standard benchmark and testbed for evaluations.
  In this survey, we provide a unified and taxonomic view of current GNN explainability
  methods. Our unified and taxonomic treatments of this subject shed lights on the
  commonalities and differences of existing methods and set the stage for further
  methodological developments. To facilitate evaluations, we generate a set of benchmark
  graph datasets specifically for GNN explainability. We summarize current datasets
  and metrics for evaluating GNN explainability. Altogether, this work provides a
  unified methodological treatment of GNN explainability and a standardized testbed
  for evaluations.
