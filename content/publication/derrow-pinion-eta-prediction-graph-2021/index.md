abstract: 'Travel-time prediction constitutes a task of high importance in transportation
  networks, with web mapping services like Google Maps regularly serving vast quantities
  of travel time queries from users and enterprises alike. Further, such a task requires
  accounting for complex spatiotemporal interactions (modelling both the topological
  properties of the road network and anticipating events -- such as rush hours --
  that may occur in the future). Hence, it is an ideal target for graph representation
  learning at scale. Here we present a graph neural network estimator for estimated
  time of arrival (ETA) which we have deployed in production at Google Maps. While
  our main architecture consists of standard GNN building blocks, we further detail
  the usage of training schedule methods such as MetaGradients in order to make our
  model robust and production-ready. We also provide prescriptive studies: ablating
  on various architectural decisions and training regimes, and qualitative analyses
  on real-world situations where our model provides a competitive edge. Our GNN proved
  powerful when deployed, significantly reducing negative ETA outcomes in several
  regions compared to the previous production baseline (40+% in cities like Sydney).'
