abstract: 'Hypergraphs are used to model higher-order interactions amongst agents
  and there exist many practically relevant instances of hypergraph datasets. To enable
  the efficient processing of hypergraph data, several hypergraph neural network platforms
  have been proposed for learning hypergraph properties and structure, with a special
  focus on node classification tasks. However, almost all existing methods use heuristic
  propagation rules and offer suboptimal performance on benchmarking datasets. We
  propose AllSet, a new hypergraph neural network paradigm that represents a highly
  general framework for (hyper)graph neural networks and for the first time implements
  hypergraph neural network layers as compositions of two multiset functions that
  can be efficiently learned for each task and each dataset. The proposed AllSet framework
  also for the first time integrates Deep Sets and Set Transformers with hypergraph
  neural networks for the purpose of learning multiset functions and therefore allows
  for significant modeling flexibility and high expressive power. To evaluate the
  performance of AllSet, we conduct the most extensive experiments to date involving
  ten known benchmarking datasets and three newly curated datasets that represent
  significant challenges for hypergraph node classification. The results demonstrate
  that our method has the unique ability to either match or outperform all other hypergraph
  neural networks across the tested datasets: As an example, the performance improvements
  over existing methods and a new method based on heterogeneous graph neural networks
  are close to $4%$ on the Yelp and Zoo datasets, and $3%$ on the Walmart dataset.'
