abstract: ABSTRACT Without foreknowledge of the complete drug target information,
  development of promising and affordable approaches for effective treatment of human
  diseases is challenging. Here, we develop deepDTnet, a deep learning methodology
  for new target identification and drug repurposing in a heterogeneous drug–gene–disease
  network embedding 15 types of chemical, genomic, phenotypic, and cellular network
  profiles. Trained on 732 U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved small molecule
  drugs, deepDTnet shows high accuracy (the area under the receiver operating characteristic
  curve = 0.963) in identifying novel molecular targets for known drugs, outperforming
  previously published state-of-the-art methodologies. We then experimentally validate
  that deepDTnet-predicted topotecan (an approved topoisomerase inhibitor) is a new,
  direct inhibitor (IC50 = 0.43 μM) of human retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan
  receptor-gamma t (ROR-γt). Furthermore, by specifically targeting ROR-γt, topotecan
  reveals a potential therapeutic effect in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. In
  summary, deepDTnet offers a powerful network-based deep learning methodology for
  target identification to accelerate drug repurposing and minimize the translational
  gap in drug development.
