abstract: 'A Sheaf Neural Network (SNN) is a type of Graph Neural Network (GNN) that
  operates on a sheaf, an object that equips a graph with vector spaces over its nodes
  and edges and linear maps between these spaces. SNNs have been shown to have useful
  theoretical properties that help tackle issues arising from heterophily and over-smoothing.
  One complication intrinsic to these models is finding a good sheaf for the task
  to be solved. Previous works proposed two diametrically opposed approaches: manually
  constructing the sheaf based on domain knowledge and learning the sheaf end-to-end
  using gradient-based methods. However, domain knowledge is often insufficient, while
  learning a sheaf could lead to overfitting and significant computational overhead.
  In this work, we propose a novel way of computing sheaves drawing inspiration from
  Riemannian geometry: we leverage the manifold assumption to compute manifold-and-graph-aware
  orthogonal maps, which optimally align the tangent spaces of neighbouring data points.
  We show that this approach achieves promising results with less computational overhead
  when compared to previous SNN models. Overall, this work provides an interesting
  connection between algebraic topology and differential geometry, and we hope that
  it will spark future research in this direction.'
