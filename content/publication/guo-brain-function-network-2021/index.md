abstract: "Brain functional network (BFN) has become an increasingly important tool
  to explore individual differences and identify neurological/mental diseases. For
  estimating a \\\"good\\\" BFN (with more discriminative information for example),
  researchers have developed various methods, in which the most popular and simplest
  is Pearson's correlation (PC). Despite its empirical effectiveness, PC only encodes
  the low-order (second-order) statistics between brain regions. To model high-order
  statistics, researchers recently proposed to estimate BFN by conducting two sequential
  PCs (denoted as PC 2 in this paper), and found that PC 2-based BFN can provide additional
  information for group difference analysis. This inspires us to think about (1) what
  will happen if continuing the correlation operation to construct much higher-order
  BFN by PC n (n$>$2), and (2) whether the higher-order correlation will result in
  stronger discriminative ability. To answer these questions, we use PC n -based BFNs
  to predict individual differences (Female vs. Male) as well as identify subjects
  with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from healthy controls (HCs). Through experiments,
  we have the following findings: (1) with the increase of n, the discriminative ability
  of PC n -based BFNs tends to decrease; (2) fusing the PC n -based BFNs (n$>$1) with
  the PC 1-based BFN can generally improve the sensitivity for MCI identification,
  but fail to help the classification accuracy. In addition, we empirically find that
  the sequence of BFN adjacency matrices estimated by PC n (n = 1,2,3,⋯,) will converge
  to a binary matrix with elements of ± 1."
