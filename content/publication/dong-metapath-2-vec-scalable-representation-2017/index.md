abstract: We study the problem of representation learning in heterogeneous networks.
  Its unique challenges come from the existence of multiple types of nodes and links,
  which limit the feasibility of the conventional network embedding techniques. We
  develop two scalable representation learning models, namely metapath2vec and metapath2vec++.
  The metapath2vec model formalizes meta-path-based random walks to construct the
  heterogeneous neighborhood of a node and then leverages a heterogeneous skip-gram
  model to perform node embeddings. The metapath2vec++ model further enables the simultaneous
  modeling of structural and semantic correlations in heterogeneous networks. Extensive
  experiments show that metapath2vec and metapath2vec++ are able to not only outperform
  state-of-the-art embedding models in various heterogeneous network mining tasks,
  such as node classification, clustering, and similarity search, but also discern
  the structural and semantic correlations between diverse network objects.
