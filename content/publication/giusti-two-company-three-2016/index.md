abstract: 'The language of graph theory, or network science, has proven to be an exceptional
  tool for addressing myriad problems in neuroscience. Yet, the use of networks is
  predicated on a critical simplifying assumption: that the quintessential unit of
  interest in a brain is a dyad – two nodes (neurons or brain regions) connected by
  an edge. While rarely mentioned, this fundamental assumption inherently limits the
  types of neural structure and function that graphs can be used to model. Here, we
  describe a generalization of graphs that overcomes these limitations, thereby offering
  a broad range of new possibilities in terms of modeling and measuring neural phenomena.
  Specifically, we explore the use of simplicial complexes: a structure developed
  in the field of mathematics known as algebraic topology, of increasing applicability
  to real data due to a rapidly growing computational toolset. We review the underlying
  mathematical formalism as well as the budding literature applying simplicial complexes
  to neural data, from electrophysiological recordings in animal models to hemodynamic
  fluctuations in humans. Based on the exceptional flexibility of the tools and recent
  ground-breaking insights into neural function, we posit that this framework has
  the potential to eclipse graph theory in unraveling the fundamental mysteries of
  cognition.'
