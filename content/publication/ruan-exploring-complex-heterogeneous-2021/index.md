abstract: The continuous emergence of drug-target interaction data provides an opportunity
  to construct a biological network for systematically discovering unknown interactions.
  However, this is challenging due to complex and heterogeneous correlations between
  drug and target. Here, we describe a heterogeneous hypergraph-based framework for
  drug-target interaction (HHDTI) predictions by modeling biological networks through
  a hypergraph, where each vertex represents a drug or a target and a hyperedge indicates
  existing similar interactions or associations between the connected vertices. The
  hypergraph is then trained to generate suitably structured embeddings for discovering
  unknown interactions. Comprehensive experiments performed on four public datasets
  demonstrate that HHDTI achieves significant and consistently improved predictions
  compared with state-of-the-art methods. Our analysis indicates that this superior
  performance is due to the ability to integrate heterogeneous high-order information
  from the hypergraph learning. These results suggest that HHDTI is a scalable and
  practical tool for uncovering novel drug-target interactions.
