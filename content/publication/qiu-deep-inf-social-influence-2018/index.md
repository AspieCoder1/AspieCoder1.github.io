abstract: Social and information networking activities such as on Facebook, Twitter,
  WeChat, and Weibo have become an indispensable part of our everyday life, where
  we can easily access friends' behaviors and are in turn influenced by them. Consequently,
  an effective social influence prediction for each user is critical for a variety
  of applications such as online recommendation and advertising.Conventional social
  influence prediction approaches typically design various hand-crafted rules to extract
  user- and network-specific features. However, their effectiveness heavily relies
  on the knowledge of domain experts. As a result, it is usually difficult to generalize
  them into different domains. Inspired by the recent success of deep neural networks
  in a wide range of computing applications, we design an end-to-end framework, DeepInf,
  to learn users' latent feature representation for predicting social influence. In
  general, DeepInf takes a user's local network as the input to a graph neural network
  for learning her latent social representation. We design strategies to incorporate
  both network structures and user-specific features into convolutional neural and
  attention networks. Extensive experiments on Open Academic Graph, Twitter, Weibo,
  and Digg, representing different types of social and information networks, demonstrate
  that the proposed end-to-end model, DeepInf, significantly outperforms traditional
  feature engineering-based approaches, suggesting the effectiveness of representation
  learning for social applications.
