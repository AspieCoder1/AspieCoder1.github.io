abstract: Digital data collection during routine clinical practice is now ubiquitous
  within hospitals. The data contains valuable information on the care of patients
  and their response to treatments, offering exciting opportunities for research.
  Typically, data are stored within archival systems that are not intended to support
  research. These systems are often inaccessible to researchers and structured for
  optimal storage, rather than interpretability and analysis. Here we present MIMIC-IV,
  a publicly available database sourced from the electronic health record of the Beth
  Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Information available includes patient measurements,
  orders, diagnoses, procedures, treatments, and deidentified free-text clinical notes.
  MIMIC-IV is intended to support a wide array of research studies and educational
  material, helping to reduce barriers to conducting clinical research.
