abstract: 'Hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) using neural networks to encode hypergraphs
  provide a promising way to model higher-order relations in data and further solve
  relevant prediction tasks built upon such higher-order relations. However, higher-order
  relations in practice contain complex patterns and are often highly irregular. So,
  it is often challenging to design an HNN that suffices to express those relations
  while keeping computational efficiency. Inspired by hypergraph diffusion algorithms,
  this work proposes a new HNN architecture named ED-HNN, which provably approximates
  any continuous equivariant hypergraph diffusion operators that can model a wide
  range of higher-order relations. ED-HNN can be implemented efficiently by combining
  star expansions of hypergraphs with standard message passing neural networks. ED-HNN
  further shows great superiority in processing heterophilic hypergraphs and constructing
  deep models. We evaluate ED-HNN for node classification on nine real-world hypergraph
  datasets. ED-HNN uniformly outperforms the best baselines over these nine datasets
  and achieves more than 2%$ uparrow$ in prediction accuracy over four datasets therein.
