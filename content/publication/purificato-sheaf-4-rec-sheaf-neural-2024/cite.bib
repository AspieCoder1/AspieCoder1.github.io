 abstract = {Recent advancements in Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have facilitated their widespread adoption in various applications, including recommendation systems. GNNs have proven to be effective in addressing the challenges posed by recommendation systems by efficiently modeling graphs in which nodes represent users or items and edges denote preference relationships. However, current GNN techniques represent nodes by means of a single static vector, which may inadequately capture the intricate complexities of users and items. To overcome these limitations, we propose a solution integrating a cutting-edge model inspired by category theory: Sheaf4Rec. Unlike single vector representations, Sheaf Neural Networks and their corresponding Laplacians represent each node (and edge) using a vector space. Our approach takes advantage from this theory and results in a more comprehensive representation that can be effectively exploited during inference, providing a versatile method applicable to a wide range of graph-related tasks and demonstrating unparalleled performance. Our proposed model exhibits a noteworthy relative improvement of up to 8.53% on F1-Score@10 and an impressive increase of up to 11.29% on NDCG@10, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models such as Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF), KGTORe and other recently developed GNN-based models. In addition to its superior predictive capabilities, Sheaf4Rec shows remarkable improvements in terms of efficiency: we observe substantial runtime improvements ranging from 2.5% up to 37% when compared to other GNN-based competitor models, indicating a more efficient way of handling information while achieving better performance.
