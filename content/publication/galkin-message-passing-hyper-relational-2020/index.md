abstract: Hyper-relational knowledge graphs (KGs) (e.g., Wikidata) enable associating
  additional key-value pairs along with the main triple to disambiguate, or restrict
  the validity of a fact. In this work, we propose a message passing based graph encoder
  - StarE capable of modeling such hyper-relational KGs. Unlike existing approaches,
  StarE can encode an arbitrary number of additional information (qualifiers) along
  with the main triple while keeping the semantic roles of qualifiers and triples
  intact. We also demonstrate that existing benchmarks for evaluating link prediction
  (LP) performance on hyper-relational KGs suffer from fundamental flaws and thus
  develop a new Wikidata-based dataset - WD50K. Our experiments demonstrate that StarE
  based LP model outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks. We also
  confirm that leveraging qualifiers is vital for link prediction with gains up to
  25 MRR points compared to triple-based representations.
