abstract: 'Higher-order relations are widespread in nature, with numerous phenomena
  involving complex interactions that extend beyond simple pairwise connections. As
  a result, advancements in higher-order processing can accelerate the growth of various
  fields requiring structured data. Current approaches typically represent these interactions
  using hypergraphs. We enhance this representation by introducing cellular sheaves
  for hypergraphs, a mathematical construction that adds extra structure to the conventional
  hypergraph while maintaining their local, higher-order connectivity. Drawing inspiration
  from existing Laplacians in the literature, we develop two unique formulations of
  sheaf hypergraph Laplacians: linear and non-linear. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates
  that incorporating sheaves into the hypergraph Laplacian provides a more expressive
  inductive bias than standard hypergraph diffusion, creating a powerful instrument
  for effectively modelling complex data structures. We employ these sheaf hypergraph
  Laplacians to design two categories of models: Sheaf Hypergraph Neural Networks
  and Sheaf Hypergraph Convolutional Networks. These models generalize classical Hypergraph
  Networks often found in the literature. Through extensive experimentation, we show
  that this generalization significantly improves performance, achieving top results
  on multiple benchmark datasets for hypergraph node classification.'
