abstract: 'Computational approaches for predicting drug–target interactions (DTIs)
  can provide valuable insights into the drug mechanism of action. DTI predictions
  can help to quickly identify new promising (on-target) or unintended (off-target)
  effects of drugs. However, existing models face several challenges. Many can only
  process a limited number of drugs and/or have poor proteome coverage. The current
  approaches also often suffer from high false positive prediction rates.We propose
  a novel computational approach for predicting drug target proteins. The approach
  is based on formulating the problem as a link prediction in knowledge graphs (robust,
  machine-readable representations of networked knowledge). We use biomedical knowledge
  bases to create a knowledge graph of entities connected to both drugs and their
  potential targets. We propose a specific knowledge graph embedding model, TriModel,
  to learn vector representations (i.e. embeddings) for all drugs and targets in the
  created knowledge graph. These representations are consequently used to infer candidate
  drug target interactions based on their scores computed by the trained TriModel
  model. We have experimentally evaluated our method using computer simulations and
  compared it to five existing models. This has shown that our approach outperforms
  all previous ones in terms of both area under ROC and precision–recall curves in
  standard benchmark tests.The data, predictions and models are available at: drugtargets.insight-centre.org.Supplementary
  data are available at Bioinformatics online.'
