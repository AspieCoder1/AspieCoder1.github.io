abstract: In many real-world network datasets such as co-authorship, co-citation,
  email communication, etc., relationships are complex and go beyond pairwise. Hypergraphs
  provide a flexible and natural modeling tool to model such complex relationships.
  The obvious existence of such complex relationships in many real-world networks
  naturaly motivates the problem of learning with hypergraphs. A popular learning
  paradigm is hypergraph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) where the goal is to
  assign labels to initially unlabeled vertices in a hypergraph. Motivated by the
  fact that a graph convolutional network (GCN) has been effective for graph-based
  SSL, we propose HyperGCN, a novel GCN for SSL on attributed hypergraphs. Additionally,
  we show how HyperGCN can be used as a learning-based approach for combinatorial
  optimisation on NP-hard hypergraph problems. We demonstrate HyperGCN's effectiveness
  through detailed experimentation on real-world hypergraphs. We have made HyperGCN's
  source code available to foster reproducible research.
