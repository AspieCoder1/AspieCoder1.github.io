 abstract = {Heterogeneous graphs with different types of nodes and edges are ubiquitous and have immense value in many applications. Existing works on modeling heterogeneous graphs usually follow the idea of splitting a heterogeneous graph into multiple homogeneous subgraphs. This is ineffective in exploiting hidden rich semantic associations between different types of edges for large-scale multi-relational graphs. In this paper, we propose Relation Structure-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (RSHN), a unified model that integrates graph and its coarsened line graph to embed both nodes and edges in heterogeneous graphs without requiring any prior knowledge such as metapath. To tackle the heterogeneity of edge connections, RSHN first creates a Coarsened Line Graph Neural Network (CL-GNN) to excavate edge-centric relation structural features that respect the latent associations of different types of edges based on coarsened line graph. After that, a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (H-GNN) is used to leverage implicit messages from neighbor nodes and edges propagating among nodes in heterogeneous graphs. As a result, different types of nodes and edges can enhance their embedding through mutual integration and promotion. Experiments and comparisons, based on semi-supervised classification tasks on large scale heterogeneous networks with over a hundred types of edges, show that RSHN significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts.},
