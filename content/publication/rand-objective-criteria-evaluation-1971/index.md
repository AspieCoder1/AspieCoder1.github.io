abstract: Many intuitively appealing methods have been suggested for clustering data,
  however, interpretation of their results has been hindered by the lack of objective
  criteria. This article proposes several criteria which isolate specific aspects
  of the performance of a method, such as its retrieval of inherent structure, its
  sensitivity to resampling and the stability of its results in the light of new data.
  These criteria depend on a measure of similarity between two different clusterings
  of the same set of data; the measure essentially considers how each pair of data
  points is assigned in each clustering.
