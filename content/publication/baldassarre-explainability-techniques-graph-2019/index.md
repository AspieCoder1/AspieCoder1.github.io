abstract: Graph Networks are used to make decisions in potentially complex scenarios
  but it is usually not obvious how or why they made them. In this work, we study
  the explainability of Graph Network decisions using two main classes of techniques,
  gradient-based and decomposition-based, on a toy dataset and a chemistry task. Our
  study sets the ground for future development as well as application to real-world
  problems.
