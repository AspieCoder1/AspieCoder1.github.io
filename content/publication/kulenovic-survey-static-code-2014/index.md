abstract: Software security is becoming highly important for universal acceptance
  of applications for many kinds of transactions. Automated code analyzers can be
  utilized to detect security vulnerabilities during the development phase. This paper
  is aimed to provide a survey on Static code analysis and how it can be used to detect
  security vulnerabilities. The most recent findings and publications are summarized
  and presented in this paper. This paper provides an overview of the gains, flows
  and algorithms of static code analyzers. It can be considered a stepping stone for
  further research in this domain.
