 abstract = {Software security is becoming highly important for universal acceptance of applications for many kinds of transactions. Automated code analyzers can be utilized to detect security vulnerabilities during the development phase. This paper is aimed to provide a survey on Static code analysis and how it can be used to detect security vulnerabilities. The most recent findings and publications are summarized and presented in this paper. This paper provides an overview of the gains, flows and algorithms of static code analyzers. It can be considered a stepping stone for further research in this domain.},
