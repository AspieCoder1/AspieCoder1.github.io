abstract: We present Graph Neural Diffusion (GRAND) that approaches deep learning
  on graphs as a continuous diffusion process and treats Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
  as discretisations of an underlying PDE. In our model, the layer structure and topology
  correspond to the discretisation choices of temporal and spatial operators. Our
  approach allows a principled development of a broad new class of GNNs that are able
  to address the common plights of graph learning models such as depth, oversmoothing,
  and bottlenecks. Key to the success of our models are stability with respect to
  perturbations in the data and this is addressed for both implicit and explicit discretisation
  schemes. We develop linear and nonlinear versions of GRAND, which achieve competitive
  results on many standard graph benchmarks.
