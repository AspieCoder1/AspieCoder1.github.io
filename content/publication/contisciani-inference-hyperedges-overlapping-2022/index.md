abstract: Hypergraphs, encoding structured interactions among any number of system
  units, have recently proven a successful tool to describe many real-world biological
  and social networks. Here we propose a framework based on statistical inference
  to characterize the structural organization of hypergraphs. The method allows to
  infer missing hyperedges of any size in a principled way, and to jointly detect
  overlapping communities in presence of higher-order interactions. Furthermore, our
  model has an efficient numerical implementation, and it runs faster than dyadic
  algorithms on pairwise records projected from higher-order data. We apply our method
  to a variety of real-world systems, showing strong performance in hyperedge prediction
  tasks, detecting communities well aligned with the information carried by interactions,
  and robustness against addition of noisy hyperedges. Our approach illustrates the
  fundamental advantages of a hypergraph probabilistic model when modeling relational
  systems with higher-order interactions. Networks with higher-order interactions
  are known to provide better representation of real networked systems. Here the authors
  introduce a framework based on statistical inference to detect overlapping communities
  and predict hyperedges of any size in hypergraphs.
