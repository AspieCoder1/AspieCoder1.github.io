abstract: Hypergraphs are expressive structures for describing higher-order relationships
  among entities, with widespread applications across biology and drug discovery.
  Hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) have recently emerged as a promising representation
  learning approach on these structures for clustering, classification, and more.
  However, despite their promising performance, HGNNs remain a black box, and explaining
  how they make predictions remains an open challenge. To address this problem, we
  propose HyperEX, a post-hoc explainability framework for hypergraphs that can be
  applied to any trained HGNN. HyperEX computes node-hyperedge pair importance to
  identify sub-hypergraphs as explanations. Our experiments demonstrate how HyperEX
  learns important sub-hypergraphs responsible for driving node classification to
  give useful insight into HGNNs.
