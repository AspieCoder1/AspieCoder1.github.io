abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a renaissance recently, making
  major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and decision-making.
  This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have
  fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many defining characteristics
  of human intelligence, which developed under much different pressures, remain out
  of reach for current approaches. In particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences--a
  hallmark of human intelligence from infancy--remains a formidable challenge for
  modern AI. The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification.
  We argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to achieve
  human-like abilities, and that structured representations and computations are key
  to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature and nurture cooperatively,
  we reject the false choice between \"hand-engineering\" and \"end-to-end\" learning,
  and instead advocate for an approach which benefits from their complementary strengths.
  We explore how using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures
  can facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them.
  We present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational inductive
  bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various approaches for neural
  networks that operate on graphs, and provides a straightforward interface for manipulating
  structured knowledge and producing structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks
  can support relational reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation
  for more sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a
  companion to this paper, we have released an open-source software library for building
  graph networks, with demonstrations of how to use them in practice.
