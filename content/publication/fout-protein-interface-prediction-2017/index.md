abstract: We consider the prediction of interfaces between proteins, a challenging
  problem with important applications in drug discovery and design, and examine the
  performance of existing and newly proposed spatial graph convolution operators for
  this task. By performing convolution over a local neighborhood of a node of interest,
  we are able to stack multiple layers of convolution and learn effective latent representations
  that integrate information across the graph that represent the three dimensional
  structure of a protein of interest. An architecture that combines the learned features
  across pairs of proteins is then used to classify pairs of amino acid residues as
  part of an interface or not. In our experiments, several graph convolution operators
  yielded accuracy that is better than the state-of-the-art SVM method in this task.
