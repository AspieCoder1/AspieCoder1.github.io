abstract: 'Recent work on predicting patient outcomes in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
  has focused heavily on the physiological time series data, largely ignoring sparse
  data such as diagnoses and medications. When they are included, they are usually
  concatenated in the late stages of a model, which may struggle to learn from rarer
  disease patterns. Instead, we propose a strategy to exploit diagnoses as relational
  information by connecting similar patients in a graph. To this end, we propose LSTM-GNN
  for patient outcome prediction tasks: a hybrid model combining Long Short-Term Memory
  networks (LSTMs) for extracting temporal features and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
  for extracting the patient neighbourhood information. We demonstrate that LSTM-GNNs
  outperform the LSTM-only baseline on length of stay prediction tasks on the eICU
  database. More generally, our results indicate that exploiting information from
  neighbouring patient cases using graph neural networks is a promising research direction,
  yielding tangible returns in supervised learning performance on Electronic Health
  Records.'
