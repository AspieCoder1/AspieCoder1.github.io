abstract: 'Forecasting the traffic flows is a critical issue for researchers and practitioners
  in the field of transportation. However, it is very challenging since the traffic
  flows usually show high nonlinearities and complex patterns. Most existing traffic
  flow prediction methods, lacking abilities of modeling the dynamic spatial-temporal
  correlations of traffic data, thus cannot yield satisfactory prediction results.
  In this paper, we propose a novel attention based spatial-temporal graph convolutional
  network (ASTGCN) model to solve traffic flow forecasting problem. ASTGCN mainly
  consists of three independent components to respectively model three temporal properties
  of traffic flows, i.e., recent, daily-periodic and weekly-periodic dependencies.
  More specifically, each component contains two major parts: 1) the spatial-temporal
  attention mechanism to effectively capture the dynamic spatialtemporal correlations
  in traffic data; 2) the spatial-temporal convolution which simultaneously employs
  graph convolutions to capture the spatial patterns and common standard convolutions
  to describe the temporal features. The output of the three components are weighted
  fused to generate the final prediction results. Experiments on two real-world datasets
  from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) demonstrate that the proposed
  ASTGCN model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.'
