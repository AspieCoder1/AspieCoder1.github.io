abstract: We develop a geometric framework, based on the classical theory of fibre
  bundles, to characterize the cohomological nature of a large class of synchronization-type
  problems in the context of graph inference and combinatorial optimization. We identify
  each synchronization problem in topological group G on connected graph $$ Gamma
  $$with a flat principal G-bundle over $$ Gamma $$, thus establishing a classification
  result for synchronization problems using the representation variety of the fundamental
  group of $$ Gamma $$into G. We then develop a twisted Hodge theory on flat vector
  bundles associated with these flat principal G-bundles, and provide a geometric
  realization of the graph connection Laplacian as the lowest-degree Hodge Laplacian
  in the twisted de Rham–Hodge cochain complex. Motivated by these geometric intuitions,
  we propose to study the problem of learning group actions—partitioning a collection
  of objects based on the local synchronizability of pairwise correspondence relations—and
  provide a heuristic synchronization-based algorithm for solving this type of problems.
  We demonstrate the efficacy of this algorithm on simulated and real datasets.
