abstract: The global set of relationships between protein targets of all drugs and
  all disease-gene products in the human protein-protein interaction or 'interactome'
  network remains uncharacterized. We built a bipartite graph composed of US Food
  and Drug Administration-approved drugs and proteins linked by drug-target binary
  associations. The resulting network connects most drugs into a highly interlinked
  giant component, with strong local clustering of drugs of similar types according
  to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification. Topological analyses of this
  network quantitatively showed an overabundance of 'follow-on' drugs, that is, drugs
  that target already targeted proteins. By including drugs currently under investigation,
  we identified a trend toward more functionally diverse targets improving polypharmacology.
  To analyze the relationships between drug targets and disease-gene products, we
  measured the shortest distance between both sets of proteins in current models of
  the human interactome network. Significant differences in distance were found between
  etiological and palliative drugs. A recent trend toward more rational drug design
  was observed.
