abstract: We introduce PyTorch Geometric, a library for deep learning on irregularly
  structured input data such as graphs, point clouds and manifolds, built upon PyTorch.
  In addition to general graph data structures and processing methods, it contains
  a variety of recently published methods from the domains of relational learning
  and 3D data processing. PyTorch Geometric achieves high data throughput by leveraging
  sparse GPU acceleration, by providing dedicated CUDA kernels and by introducing
  efficient mini-batch handling for input examples of different size. In this work,
  we present the library in detail and perform a comprehensive comparative study of
  the implemented methods in homogeneous evaluation scenarios.
