  Deep learning has been successfully applied to detecting and repairing bugs in source code.
  A large amount of useful semantic information is captured inside the structure and relational properties of the source code.
  Graphs and hypergraphs provide a natural way to model these relationships.
  This talk explores how graph neural networks (GNNs) can be applies to automatic program repair (APR) tasks.
